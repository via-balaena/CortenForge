# CortenForge Sim — v1.0 Roadmap

> **Status**: Draft — 2026-03-02
> **Scope**: All remaining work from `future_work_10.md` (§41+) through `future_work_17.md`,
> plus the ~112 deferred tasks in `future_work_10b.md`–`10j` (DT-1 through DT-116).
> DT-93/94/95 were added during §41 spec and subsumed into §41.

## What is v1.0?

v1.0 is a Rust implementation of MuJoCo's core simulation pipeline that:

1. Parses standard MJCF models correctly
2. Produces physics results that match MuJoCo 3.4.0 within tolerance
3. Exposes the standard MuJoCo public API surface (step, forward, inverse, derivatives, name lookup, callbacks)
4. Passes the conformance test suite (§45)

v1.0 is **not**: GPU acceleration, trait-based solver extensibility, NeoHookean soft bodies,
URDF completeness, XPBD, or any feature that doesn't exist in the MuJoCo C library.

---

## Summary

| Category | Core v1.0 | Extra / Post-v1.0 |
|----------|----------:|-----------:|
| future_work_10 (§41+) | 5 | 8 |
| future_work_10b–10j (DT-1–92) | ~40 | ~52 |
| future_work_11 (§43–45) | 2 | 1 |
| future_work_12 (§46–50) | 3 | 2 |
| future_work_13 (§51–55) | 5 | 0 |
| future_work_14 (§56–59) | 4 | 0 |
| future_work_15 (§60–64a) | 6 | 0 |
| future_work_16 (§65–66) | 2 | 0 |
| future_work_17 (§67–71) | 0 | 5 |
| **Total** | **~67** | **~68** |

---

## Spec Tiers

Each DT item has a **Tier** governing the spec approach:

- **T1** — Plan + implement directly. Mechanical work; parent spec defines the "what."
- **T2** — Grouped spec. Related items share one spec; each gets a "Step N" section. (~15 spec groups)
- **T3** — Individual spec. Algorithmic complexity or architectural decisions needing dedicated design.
- **—** — Non-DT tasks (§-numbered). Specced in their own future_work_*.md files.

See [future_work_10b.md](./todo/future_work_10b.md) for the full T2 group listing.

---

## v1.0 Critical Path

Ordered by priority. Each phase should be completed and committed before
moving to the next. Within a phase, tasks are independent and can be
parallelized.

---

### Phase 1 — Correctness Bugs

Fix known physics bugs before building more on top of them. These are small,
high-value, and reduce the chance of compounding errors in later work.

| Task | Source | Tier | Description |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| ~~DT-74~~ | 10j | T3 | ~~`compute_body_jacobian_at_point()` incomplete — only x-component implemented~~ **DONE** — canonical `mj_jac` API, dead code deleted, 14 tests |
| ~~DT-75~~ | 10j | T3 | ~~`add_body_jacobian` free joint bug — world-frame vectors instead of body-frame `R*e_i`~~ **DONE** — body-frame axes fix in 3 locations, 6 tests |
| ~~DT-35~~ | 10d | T3 | ~~Tendon spring/damper forces produce zero in implicit mode — missing non-diagonal K coupling~~ **DONE** — implicit tendon K/D via `accumulate_tendon_kd`, Newton `M_impl`/`qfrc_eff`, `ten_force` diagnostic always populated, 18 tests |
| ~~DT-16~~ | 10b | T1 | ~~Flex `density` attribute location wrong in parser vs MuJoCo spec~~ **DONE** — removed non-conformant density parsing from `parse_flex_attrs()` |
| ~~DT-90~~ | 10i | T1 | ~~`flex_friction` scalar should be `Vector3<f64>` — torsional/rolling friction data lost~~ **DONE** — `flex_friction` upgraded to `Vec<Vector3<f64>>` end-to-end (parser → builder → model → collision) |
| ~~DT-78~~ | 10j | T2 | ~~`actuator_lengthrange` DOF lookup wrong for unlimited spatial tendons~~ **DONE** — spatial tendon guard in `muscle.rs`, landed in §4 step 5 |

| DT-5 | 10b | T2 | `gaintype/biastype/dyntype="user"` callback-based types |
| DT-7 | 10b | T1 | `actdim` explicit override |
| DT-10 | 10b | T1 | Deferred `<compiler>` attributes (`fitaabb`, `usethread`, etc.) |
| DT-12 | 10b | T1 | Programmatic enforcement that `worldbody.childclass` = None |
| DT-15 | 10b | T1 | Sentinel-value detection → `Option<T>` migration. Phase 7 Spec A added 14 sentinel-detection fields in `apply_to_actuator()` (defaults.rs:441-512) — primary migration candidates. |
| DT-17 | 10b | T1 | Global `<option o_margin>` override. Phase 7 Spec B (§64a) implemented per-joint `jnt_margin`; this covers the separate global option. |
| DT-22 | 10c | T1 | `efc_impP` impedance derivative field |
| DT-31 | 10d | T2 | `WrapType::Joint` inside spatial tendons |
| DT-65 | 10h | T1 | User sensor `dim` attribute. Also requires `sensor_intprm` array (`mjmodel.h:1213`). |
| DT-69 | 10i | T2 | SAP for flex broadphase (currently brute-force) |
| DT-72 | 10i | T1 | Flex contacts wired for adhesion |
| DT-80 | 10j | T1 | Mocap body + equality weld integration testing |
| DT-81 | 10j | T1 | `key_userdata` support |
| DT-84 | 10j | T1 | `mju_encodePyramid` utility |
| DT-89 | 10i | T1 | `<flexcomp>` rendering attributes |
| DT-104 | 10b | T2 | Ball/free joint transmission — `nv == 3` and `nv == 6` sub-paths in `mj_transmission()`. Deferred from Phase 5 Spec B. |
| DT-107 | 10g | T2 | Runtime interpolation logic — `mj_forward` reads history buffer for delayed ctrl, `mj_step` writes circular buffer. Covers both actuators (Phase 5 Spec D) and sensors (Phase 6 Spec D): structures exist for both, runtime missing for both. Includes sensor history pre-population in `reset_data()`. |
| DT-108 | 10g | T1 | `dyntype` enum gating interpolation eligibility — restrict which `ActuatorDynamics` variants may use history buffer. Deferred from Phase 5 Spec D. |
| DT-110 | 10g | T1 | `actuator_plugin` model array — per-actuator plugin ID (`int[nu]`, -1 sentinel). Depends on §66. Deferred from Phase 5 Spec D. |
| DT-118 | 15 | T2 | `mj_contactForce()` — touch sensor force reconstruction via full contact force vector. Deferred from Phase 6 Spec A. |
| DT-119 | 15 | T2 | Ray-geom intersection filter for touch sensor — filter contacts by surface normal alignment. Depends on DT-118. Deferred from Phase 6 Spec A. |
| DT-120 | 15 | T1 | `MjObjectType::Camera` — frame sensor camera support (reftype="camera" currently warns + ignores). Deferred from Phase 6 Spec B. |
| DT-121 | 15 | T1 | `InsideSite` sensor (`mjSENS_INSIDESITE`) — MuJoCo 3.x sensor type not yet supported. Deferred from Phase 6 Spec C. |
| DT-122 | 15 | T2 | Mesh/Hfield/SDF geom distance support for `GeomDist`/`GeomPoint`/`GeomNormal` sensors. Deferred from Phase 6 Spec C. |
| DT-123 | 10b | T1 | `IntVelocity` enum variant — concrete `<intvelocity>` elements not yet supported (defaults parsing works). Deferred from Phase 7 Spec A. |
| DT-124 | 10b | T1 | Muscle sentinel detection for `<general dyntype="muscle">` path (`gainprm[0]==1` quirk). Known conformance divergence. Deferred from Phase 7 Spec A. |
| DT-125 | 15 | T2 | `mj_setConst()` runtime `qpos_spring` recomputation — when `mj_setConst()` is called at runtime, `qpos_spring` must be recomputed from current `qpos0`/`springref` via `setSpring()` logic (`engine_setconst.c`). Currently `qpos_spring` is set at build time and static. Deferred from Phase 7 Spec B. |

### Code Quality
| Task | Source | Tier | Description |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| DT-117 | xtask check | T2 | Eliminate `unwrap()`/`expect()` from library code (~1,085 call sites). Convert to `?` propagation, `Result` returns, or `unsafe { get_unchecked() }` with safety invariant comments where bounds are structurally guaranteed. Prevents unrecoverable panics for library consumers. |

### Other Non-Critical
| Task | Source | Tier | Description |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| §42 | 10 | — | `<flex>`/`<flexcomp>` parsing (subsumed by §6B) |
| §44 | 11 | — | Deprecate legacy standalone crates |
| §47 | 12 | — | URDF loader completeness (mesh collision, mimic joints, etc.) |
| §49 | 12 | — | Non-physics MJCF elements (`<visual>`, `<statistic>`, `<custom>`, `<size>`) |
| DT-71 | 10i | T1 | Behavioral friction tests for deformables |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision |
|------|----------|
| 2026-02-21 | Triaged all ~135 remaining tasks into core v1.0 (~67) vs extra (~68). Core defined as "matches MuJoCo C library behavior, passes conformance." |
| 2026-02-21 | Split `future_work_10b.md` into 9 files (10b–10j), one per thematic group. Updated all ~75 back-references across future_work_1–9, index.md, and ROADMAP. |
| 2026-02-21 | Classified all 92 DT items into spec tiers: T1 (32 plan+implement), T2 (39 grouped into ~15 specs), T3 (21 individual specs). Added Tier column to all 10b–10j tables and ROADMAP. |
