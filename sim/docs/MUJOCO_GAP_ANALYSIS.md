This document provides a comprehensive comparison between MuJoCo's physics capabilities and CortenForge's current `sim-*` crate implementation.

> **Note:** All `sim-*` crates are in initial development (pre-1.0). Breaking changes to APIs are expected and acceptable. Prefer clean, correct implementations over backwards compatibility.

> **Current Roadmap:** For the authoritative list of verified gaps with file:line references, acceptance criteria, and dependency graph, see [`sim/docs/todo/index.md`](./todo/index.md).

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Overall completion: ~90-95%** of MuJoCo's core pipeline features are functional end-to-end. Phase 1 (12 items) and Phase 2 (16 items) are complete. Remaining gaps are tracked in Phase 3 (#18–71, ordered for optimal implementation across 6 sub-groups). See [`sim/docs/todo/index.md`](./todo/index.md) for the full roadmap.

**Remaining gaps (Phase 3, optimal implementation order):**
- **3A-i Parser Fundamentals** (#18–22): ~~`<include>` + `<compiler>`~~ ✅, ~~`<frame>` element~~ ✅, ~~`childclass` attribute~~ ✅, ~~`<site>` orientation~~ ✅ (partial, core in #19), tendon `springlength`
- **3A-ii Inertia + Contact Parameters** (#23–27): `exactmeshinertia`, friction combination (geometric mean → element-wise max), `geom/@priority`, `solmix`, contact margin/gap
- **3A-iii Constraint System Overhaul** (#28–32): friction loss migration (Newton Huber → PGS/CG → unified constraints), `solreffriction`, pyramidal cones

- **3A-vi Cleanup + Conformance** (#43–45): `shellinertia`, legacy crate deprecation, MuJoCo conformance test suite (depends on all #19–44)
- **3B Format + Performance** (#46–50): `<composite>`, URDF completeness, SIMD audit, non-physics MJCF, CCD
- **3C API + Pipeline** (#51–59): body accumulators, mj_inverse, step1/step2, heightfield gaps, user data, subtree fields, SDF options, position derivatives, name lookup
- **3D Edge-Case Features** (#60–66): springinertia, slidercrank, missing sensors, dynprm, ball/free spring energy, mesh convex hull, plugin/extension
- **3E GPU Pipeline** (#67–71): GPU FK (10b), broad-phase (10c), narrow-phase (10d), constraint solver (10e), full GPU step (10f)

### Placeholder / Stub (in pipeline)
- Pyramidal friction cones — `cone` field stored but solver uses elliptic cones (warning emitted if pyramidal requested)

### Recently Implemented (previously stubs)
- Site-transmission actuators ✅ — 6D gear, refsite, `mj_jac_site()`, `mj_transmission_site()`, `subquat()`, common-ancestor DOF zeroing, `ActuatorFrc` sensor fix, 23 integration tests + 9 unit tests ([future_work_2 #5](./todo/future_work_2.md))

- sim-sensor (rangefinder, magnetometer, force/torque) — standalone crate with own API; pipeline has independent implementations
- CGSolver in sim-constraint (1,664 lines) — standalone joint-space CG; pipeline contact CG is separate in `mujoco_pipeline.rs` ([future_work_1 #3](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅)
- ~~`integrators.rs` trait system~~ — removed in FUTURE_WORK C1
- Pneumatic actuators in sim-constraint — standalone `PneumaticCylinderActuator`; pipeline cylinder/adhesion actuators use gain/bias model ([future_work_1 #12](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅)
- Universal, Planar, Cylindrical joints in sim-constraint — CortenForge extensions, not MuJoCo joint types (not in pipeline `MjJointType`)

### Removed (Phase 3 Consolidation — standalone crate code only)
- Standalone Newton solver (`sim-constraint/src/newton.rs` — deleted; replaced by pipeline-native `newton_solve()` in `mujoco_pipeline.rs`)
- Standalone constraint island discovery (`sim-constraint/src/islands.rs` — deleted; replaced by pipeline-native `mj_island()` DFS flood-fill in `mujoco_pipeline.rs`)
- Standalone sparse Jacobian operations (`sim-constraint/src/sparse.rs` — deleted)
- Standalone PGS (`sim-constraint/src/pgs.rs` — deleted; pipeline PGS in `mujoco_pipeline.rs` is MuJoCo-aligned pure Gauss-Seidel)
- Standalone island-parallel constraint solving (`sim-constraint/src/parallel.rs` — deleted; per-island block-diagonal solving now in `mj_fwd_constraint_islands()`)

## 1. Integration Methods

|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| Semi-implicit Euler | Default | `SemiImplicitEuler` | **Implemented** | - | - |

### Implementation Notes: Implicit Integration ✅ COMPLETED

Three implicit integrator variants are implemented:

**`ImplicitSpringDamper` (legacy diagonal-only):**
- Solves: `(M + h·D + h²·K)·v_new = M·v_old + h·f_ext - h·K·(q - q_eq)`
- D and K are diagonal (per-DOF damping and stiffness only)
- MJCF: `integrator="implicitspringdamper"`

**`ImplicitFast` (full Jacobian, Cholesky):**
- Solves: `(M − h·D)·qacc = qfrc_smooth + qfrc_applied + qfrc_constraint`
- D = ∂(qfrc_smooth)/∂(qvel) via `mjd_passive_vel` + `mjd_actuator_vel`
- D is symmetrized: `D ← (D + D^T)/2`, then Cholesky factorization
- MJCF: `integrator="implicitfast"`

**`Implicit` (full Jacobian, LU):**
- Same as ImplicitFast but includes Coriolis derivatives (`mjd_rne_vel`)
- D is asymmetric, solved via LU with partial pivoting
- MJCF: `integrator="implicit"`

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_mjcf::load_model;

let mjcf = r#"<mujoco>
    <option integrator="implicit"/>
    <worldbody>
        <body pos="0 0 1">
            <joint type="hinge" stiffness="100" damping="10"/>
            <geom type="sphere" size="0.1" mass="1"/>
        </body>
    </worldbody>
</mujoco>"#;

let model = load_model(mjcf).expect("load");
let mut data = model.make_data();
data.step(&model).expect("step");
```

**Files:** `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs` (`Integrator::ImplicitSpringDamper`, `Integrator::ImplicitFast`, `Integrator::Implicit`)

## 2. Constraint Solvers

| Feature | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| PGS (Gauss-Seidel) | Supported (pure GS, no SOR) | `pgs_solve_contacts()` in pipeline | **Implemented** (MuJoCo-aligned) | - | - |
| Newton solver | Default, 2-5 iterations | `newton_solve()` in pipeline | **Implemented** (reduced primal formulation, §15; [future_work_5](./todo/future_work_5.md) ✅) | - | - |
| Conjugate Gradient | Supported | `cg_solve_contacts()` in pipeline (PGD+BB, named "CG") | **Implemented** ([future_work_1 #3](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| Constraint islands | Auto-detected | `mj_island()` (pipeline DFS flood-fill) | **Implemented** (replaced old `islands.rs` with pipeline-native island discovery + per-island solving) | - | - |
| Warm starting | Supported | `WarmstartKey` spatial hash + `efc_lambda` | **Implemented** | - | - |

> **Note:** The pipeline has four solver variants in `SolverType` enum (`mujoco_pipeline.rs`): **Newton** (reduced primal formulation, §15 — quadratic convergence in 2-5 iterations, falls back to PGS on Cholesky failure), **PGS** (pure Gauss-Seidel, ω=1.0 — MuJoCo-aligned, no SOR), **CG** (preconditioned PGD with Barzilai-Borwein step size, falls back to PGS on non-convergence), and **CGStrict** (same as CG but returns zero forces instead of PGS fallback — used in tests to detect convergence regressions). All share `assemble_contact_system()` for Delassus assembly. PGS matches MuJoCo's `mj_solPGS` — pure GS with no SOR (verified against `engine_solver.c`; `mjOption` has no `sor` field). `CGSolver` in `sim-constraint/src/cg.rs` remains a standalone joint-space solver unrelated to the pipeline contact solvers.

### Implementation Notes: Newton Solver ✅ IMPLEMENTED (pipeline-native, §15)

> **History:** An earlier standalone `NewtonConstraintSolver` in `sim-constraint/src/newton.rs` was
> removed in Phase 3 consolidation (dead code — never called by pipeline). A ground-up
> pipeline-native Newton solver was then implemented as §15 in the pipeline.

The pipeline Newton solver (`newton_solve()` in `mujoco_pipeline.rs`) uses a reduced primal
formulation operating on the unified constraint Jacobian (equality, friction loss, limits, contacts):

- **Reduced primal formulation**: Optimizes over constraint forces directly
- **Phase A**: Assemble unified constraint system (Jacobian, residuals, cost)
- **Phase B**: Newton iterations with Cholesky factorization of Hessian
- **Phase C**: Per-step meaninertia scaling for configuration-dependent conditioning
- Falls back to PGS on Cholesky failure or non-convergence
- Typically converges in 2-5 iterations (quadratic convergence)
- Selected via `<option solver="Newton"/>` in MJCF

**Files:** `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs` (`newton_solve()`, `SolverType::Newton`); see [future_work_5 §15](./todo/future_work_5.md) ✅

### Implementation Notes: PGS (Gauss-Seidel) Solver ⚠️ REMOVED from sim-constraint; reimplemented in pipeline

> The standalone `PGSSolver` in `sim-constraint/src/pgs.rs` was **deleted in Phase 3 consolidation**. That solver included an SOR (Successive Over-Relaxation) parameter — this was a design error based on the incorrect assumption that MuJoCo uses SOR in its PGS. Verification against MuJoCo source (`engine_solver.c`, `mj_solPGS`) confirms MuJoCo uses pure Gauss-Seidel with no SOR blending; `mjOption` has no `sor` field and `<option>` has no `sor` attribute.

The pipeline PGS in `mujoco_pipeline.rs` (`pgs_solve_contacts()`) correctly uses pure Gauss-Seidel (ω=1.0), matching MuJoCo's implementation. SOR was considered as future work (§17) but was dropped after the MuJoCo source verification.

**Files:** `sim-constraint/src/pgs.rs` (removed in Phase 3 consolidation)

### Implementation Notes: Constraint Islands ✅ REIMPLEMENTED (pipeline-native)

> **History:** The original `ConstraintIslands` in `sim-constraint/src/islands.rs` used Union-Find
> with the Newton solver. It was removed in Phase 3 consolidation. Island discovery has been
> reimplemented directly in the MuJoCo pipeline as part of the sleeping system.

**Current implementation** (`mj_island()` in `mujoco_pipeline.rs`):
- DFS flood-fill over tree-tree adjacency graph (trees connected by contacts, tendons, or equality constraints)
- Produces island arrays: `tree_island`, `island_ntree`, `dof_island`, `contact_island`, `efc_island`, etc.
- `mj_fwd_constraint_islands()` solves each island independently via block-diagonal decomposition
- Single-island scenes use the global solver path (no overhead)
- Controlled by `DISABLE_ISLAND` flag (disable via `<flag island="disable"/>`)

**Files:** `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs` (`mj_island`, `mj_fwd_constraint_islands`),
`sim/L0/tests/integration/sleeping.rs` (island-related tests)

## 3. Contact Model

| Feature | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| Compliant contacts | Core | Inline in PGS solver (`mujoco_pipeline.rs`) | **Implemented** | - | - |
| Spring-damper (F = k*d^p + c*v) | Core | `compute_normal_force_magnitude` | **Standalone** (in sim-simd `batch_ops.rs` only; pipeline uses constraint-based PGS, not penalty spring-damper) | - | - |
| Nonlinear stiffness (d^p) | Core | `stiffness_power` param | **Standalone** (same as above — sim-simd only) | - | - |
| Contact margin | Supported | `contact_margin` param | **Implemented** (field stored; effect on collision thresholds TBD) | - | - |
| Elliptic friction cones | Default | `Model.cone = 1`, `project_elliptic_cone()` | **Implemented** (two-step projection: unilateral constraint + friction scaling) | - | - |
| Pyramidal friction cones | Alternative | `Model.cone` field | **Stub** (warning emitted, falls back to elliptic — requires different system size) | - | - |
| Variable condim (1/3/4/6) | Core | `Contact.dim`, `efc_offsets`, variable-dim solvers | **Implemented** (full variable-dimension support in PGS/CG) | - | - |
| Torsional friction | condim ≥ 4 | `Contact.mu[2]`, angular Jacobian row 3 | **Implemented** (Jacobian + solver + `apply_contact_torque()`) | - | - |
| Rolling friction | condim = 6 | `Contact.mu[3..5]`, angular Jacobian rows 4-5 | **Implemented** (Jacobian + solver + `apply_contact_torque()`) | - | - |
| Complete friction model | condim 6 | All components integrated | **Implemented** (condim 1, 3, 4, 6 all functional) | - | - |
| Contact pairs filtering | Supported | `contype`/`conaffinity` bitmasks, `<exclude>` body-pair exclusions, `<pair>` explicit pairs | **Implemented** (two-mechanism architecture) | - | - |
| solref/solimp params | MuJoCo-specific | `jnt_solref`, `geom_solimp`, `eq_solref`, etc. in `Model` | **Implemented** (in MuJoCo pipeline) | - | - |

### Implementation Notes: Elliptic Friction Cones ✅ IMPLEMENTED

MuJoCo uses elliptic cones by default:
```
f_n ≥ 0, ||(f_t1/μ_1, f_t2/μ_2, ...)|| ≤ f_n
```

**Implemented (February 2026):**
- `project_elliptic_cone()` — Two-step physical projection:
  1. Unilateral constraint: if λ_n < 0, contact releases (all forces = 0)
  2. Friction scaling: if friction exceeds cone, scale by λ_n/s
- `project_friction_cone()` — Dispatcher for condim 1/3/4/6
- `Model.cone = 1` (elliptic) as default; pyramidal emits warning and falls back
- Per-contact `mu: [f64; 5]` for [sliding1, sliding2, torsional, rolling1, rolling2]

**Files modified:** `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs` (lines 13185-13220)

### Implementation Notes: Variable Condim + Advanced Friction Models ✅ IMPLEMENTED

MuJoCo uses contact dimensionality (`condim`) to specify which friction components are active:
- **condim 1**: Normal force only (frictionless) — `lambda[0]` clamped ≥ 0
- **condim 3**: Normal + 2D tangential friction (sliding) — elliptic cone projection
- **condim 4**: condim 3 + torsional friction (spinning resistance) — angular Jacobian row 3
- **condim 6**: condim 4 + 2D rolling friction (rolling resistance) — angular Jacobian rows 4-5

**Implemented (February 2026):**
- `compute_efc_offsets()` — Per-contact row offsets for variable-dimension system
- `compute_contact_jacobian()` — Returns `dim×nv` matrix with angular rows for condim ≥ 4
- `add_angular_jacobian()` — Helper for torsional/rolling Jacobian rows
- `apply_contact_torque()` — Maps world torque to generalized forces via angular Jacobian transpose
- `compute_block_jacobi_preconditioner()` — Variable `dim×dim` blocks
- `Data.efc_lambda: HashMap<WarmstartKey, Vec<f64>>` — Variable-length warmstart
- PGS and CG solvers updated for variable-dimension indexing

**Torsional Friction (condim ≥ 4):**
Opposes rotation about the contact normal (spinning). Applied via `apply_contact_torque()`:
```rust
let torsional_torque = normal * lambda[3];
apply_contact_torque(model, data, body1, -torsional_torque);
apply_contact_torque(model, data, body2, torsional_torque);
```

**Rolling Friction (condim = 6):**
Opposes rotation perpendicular to the contact normal. Applied via `apply_contact_torque()`:
```
τ_roll = -μ_roll * r_roll * F_n * normalize(ω_tangent)
```

**Pyramidal Friction Cones:**
Linearized approximation of circular/elliptic cones using flat faces. Useful for:
- LCP/QP constraint solvers requiring linear constraints
- Exact projection (no iteration needed)
- Complementarity-based contact methods

The pyramid circumscribes the circular cone (vertices touch the circle). More faces = better accuracy but more constraints.

### Implementation Notes: Collision Pipeline

The collision detection pipeline now uses:
1. ✅ **Broad-phase**: Sweep-and-prune with automatic axis selection (O(n log n))
   - `SweepAndPrune` for scenes with >32 bodies
   - `BruteForce` fallback for small scenes
   - Configurable via `BroadPhaseConfig`
2. ✅ **Mid-phase**: AABB tree per complex body for mesh primitive culling
   - `Bvh` - Top-down BVH with median splitting
   - `BvhPrimitive` - Triangle/primitive storage with AABB
   - `bvh_from_triangle_mesh()` - Helper for building BVH from mesh
3. ✅ **Narrow-phase**: GJK for intersection testing, EPA for penetration depth

**Files:** `sim-core/src/mid_phase.rs`, `sim-core/src/gjk_epa.rs`, `sim-core/src/collision_shape.rs`

### Implementation Notes: GJK/EPA ✅ COMPLETED

GJK (Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi) and EPA (Expanding Polytope Algorithm) provide
general convex collision detection for arbitrary convex shapes.

**GJK Algorithm:**
- Works in Minkowski difference space (A - B)
- Iteratively builds a simplex to enclose the origin
- Returns true if shapes intersect (origin inside Minkowski difference)
- Complexity: O(n) iterations, each O(v) where v is vertex count

**EPA Algorithm:**
- Runs after GJK confirms intersection
- Expands the GJK simplex into a polytope
- Finds the closest face to the origin
- Returns penetration depth and contact normal

**Implemented:**
- `CollisionShape::ConvexMesh` - Convex hull defined by vertices
- `CollisionShape::tetrahedron()` - Helper for regular tetrahedra
- Support functions for all shape types (sphere, box, capsule, plane, convex mesh)
- `gjk_intersection()` - Fast intersection test
- `gjk_epa_contact()` - Full contact information (point, normal, depth)
- Automatic GJK/EPA fallback for capsule-box and other mixed collisions

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_core::CollisionShape;
use nalgebra::{Point3, Vector3};

// Create a convex mesh (e.g., from a convex hull)
let vertices = vec![
    Point3::new(-0.5, -0.5, -0.5),
    Point3::new(0.5, -0.5, -0.5),
    Point3::new(0.5, 0.5, -0.5),
    Point3::new(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5),
    Point3::new(-0.5, -0.5, 0.5),
    Point3::new(0.5, -0.5, 0.5),
    Point3::new(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
    Point3::new(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
];
let shape = CollisionShape::convex_mesh(vertices);

// Or use the tetrahedron helper
let tetra = CollisionShape::tetrahedron(0.5); // circumradius 0.5
```

## 6. Joint Types

| Joint | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Fixed (weld) | Yes | `FixedJoint` | **Implemented** | |
| Hinge (revolute) | Yes | `RevoluteJoint` | **Implemented** | |
| Slide (prismatic) | Yes | `PrismaticJoint` | **Implemented** | |
| Ball (spherical) | Yes | `SphericalJoint` | **Implemented** | |
| Free (6 DOF) | Yes | `FreeJoint` | **Implemented** | Full constraint solver support |
| Universal | No (CortenForge-only) | `UniversalJoint` | **Standalone** | In sim-constraint; not a MuJoCo joint type |
| Planar | No (CortenForge-only) | `PlanarJoint` | **Standalone** | In sim-constraint; not a MuJoCo joint type |
| Cylindrical | No (CortenForge-only) | `CylindricalJoint` | **Standalone** | In sim-constraint; not a MuJoCo joint type |

### Implementation Notes: Free Joint ✅ COMPLETED (pipeline); Universal/Planar/Cylindrical are Standalone (not MuJoCo types)

FreeJoint is fully implemented in the pipeline. Universal, Planar, and Cylindrical joints exist in sim-constraint as CortenForge extensions — MuJoCo does not have these joint types (MuJoCo's 4 types are: hinge, slide, ball, free). They are not in the pipeline's `MjJointType` enum:

**FreeJoint (6 DOF floating bodies):**
- Used for floating-base robots (quadrupeds, humanoids, drones)
- Zero constraints (all 6 DOF free)
- Includes linear and angular damping
- Methods: `set_position()`, `set_rotation()`, `compute_damping_force()`

**PlanarJoint (3 DOF: x, y translation + rotation):**
- Used for mobile robots on flat surfaces
- 3 constraints: 1 translation (perpendicular to plane) + 2 rotation (tilt)
- Configurable plane normal
- Methods: `set_position()`, `set_angle()`, `translation()`, `rotation()`

**CylindricalJoint (2 DOF: rotation + translation along axis):**
- Combination of revolute + prismatic along same axis
- 4 constraints: 2 translation + 2 rotation (perpendicular to axis)
- Supports separate rotation and translation limits, motors, and damping
- Methods: `set_angle()`, `set_displacement()`, `compute_joint_forces()`

**Constraint solver support added to:**
- `ConstraintSolver` (Gauss-Seidel): `solve_free_constraint()`, `solve_planar_constraint()`, `solve_cylindrical_constraint()` (removed in Phase 3 consolidation — `ConstraintSolver` was in `solver.rs`; `BodyState`/`JointForce` extracted to `types.rs`)
- `NewtonConstraintSolver`: Jacobian and error computation for all three types (removed in Phase 3 consolidation — was in `newton.rs`)
- `CGSolver`: Jacobian and error computation for all three types (kept — `cg.rs`)
- MJCF loader: Updated to parse `cylindrical` and `planar` joint types

## 7. Actuators

| Actuator | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| Motor (direct torque) | Yes | `mj_fwd_actuation()` (gain/bias: `force = 1.0 * ctrl`) | **Implemented** | - | - |
| Position servo | Yes | `mj_fwd_actuation()` (gain/bias: `force = kp*input - kp*length - kv*velocity`; FilterExact dynamics when `timeconst > 0`) | **Implemented** ([future_work_1 #12](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| Velocity servo | Yes | `mj_fwd_actuation()` (gain/bias: `force = kv*ctrl - kv*velocity`) | **Implemented** ([future_work_1 #12](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| PD control | Yes | Position servo with `kp` + `kv` (equivalent to PD control) | **Implemented** (via Position actuator with explicit `kv`) | - | - |
| Integrated velocity | Yes | `IntegratedVelocityActuator` | **Standalone** (in sim-constraint, not in pipeline) | - | - |
| Damper | Yes | `mj_fwd_actuation()` (gain/bias: Affine gain `= -kv*velocity`, `force = gain * ctrl`; `ctrllimited` enforced) | **Implemented** ([future_work_1 #12](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| Cylinder (pneumatic) | Yes | `mj_fwd_actuation()` (gain/bias: `force = area*act + bias[0] + bias[1]*length + bias[2]*velocity`; Filter dynamics with `timeconst`) | **Implemented** ([future_work_1 #12](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| Muscle (MuJoCo FLV) | Yes | MuJoCo FLV in pipeline + `HillMuscle` (standalone via sim-muscle) | **Implemented** (MuJoCo-compatible FLV curves, activation dynamics, act_dot architecture; [future_work_1 #5](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| Adhesion | Yes | `mj_fwd_actuation()` (gain/bias: `force = gain * ctrl`; `ctrllimited` enforced) | **Implemented** ([future_work_1 #12](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅) | - | - |
| General (custom) | Yes | MJCF `gaintype`/`biastype`/`dyntype`/`gainprm`/`biasprm`/`dynprm` parsed on `<general>`, wired through defaults and model builder to runtime dispatch | **Implemented** ([future_work_3 #8](./todo/future_work_3.md) ✅) | - | - |

> **Pipeline vs standalone actuators.** The MuJoCo pipeline's `mj_fwd_actuation()` implements a 3-phase architecture: (1) compute `act_dot` per `ActuatorDynamics` type (None → ctrl passthrough, Muscle → Millard activation dynamics, Filter/FilterExact → first-order filter, Integrator → ctrl), (2) compute force via general gain/bias formula `force = gain * input + bias` dispatched on `GainType`/`BiasType` (Fixed, Affine, Muscle), (3) map force to generalized coordinates via transmission J^T. All 8 MJCF shortcut actuator types (Motor, Position, Velocity, Damper, Cylinder, Adhesion, Muscle, General) are expanded to their general gain/bias/dynamics representation in the model builder, matching MuJoCo's `user_api.cc`. Control clamping (`ctrlrange`, gated by `ctrllimited`) and force clamping (`forcerange`, gated by `forcelimited`) are enforced. Damper and Adhesion actuators force `ctrllimited=true`. `data.act` is integrated by the Euler/RK4 integrator using `act_dot` (activation is never modified inside `mj_fwd_actuation` — matching MuJoCo's `mjData.act_dot` convention). FilterExact uses exact discrete integration `act += act_dot * tau * (1 - exp(-h/tau))` while Filter uses Euler. `ActuatorTransmission::Site` is fully implemented with 6D gear vector, refsite (Mode A/B), `mj_jac_site()`, `mj_transmission_site()`, `subquat()`, and common-ancestor zeroing ([future_work_2 §5](./todo/future_work_2.md) ✅). The sim-muscle crate (2,550 lines) provides a richer Hill-type model as a standalone alternative; sim-constraint actuators (`JointMotor`, `IntegratedVelocityActuator`, `PneumaticCylinderActuator`, `AdhesionActuator`, `CustomActuator`) remain standalone.

### Implementation Notes: Muscle Model ✅ COMPLETED (pipeline + standalone)

MuJoCo's muscle model includes:
- Activation dynamics (1st-order system)
- Force-length-velocity relationships
- Pennation angle

**Pipeline implementation (MuJoCo FLV model in `mujoco_pipeline.rs`):**

MuJoCo's simplified FLV muscle model is implemented directly in the pipeline,
matching `mju_muscleGain`, `mju_muscleBias`, and `mju_muscleDynamics` from
`engine_util_misc.c`. Key components:

- `muscle_gain_length()` — piecewise-quadratic active force-length curve
- `muscle_gain_velocity()` — piecewise-quadratic force-velocity curve
- `muscle_passive_force()` — passive force (quadratic onset, linear beyond midpoint)
- `muscle_activation_dynamics()` — Millard et al. (2013) with activation-dependent
  time constants: `τ_act_eff = τ_act * (0.5 + 1.5*act)`,
  `τ_deact_eff = τ_deact / (0.5 + 1.5*act)`
- `sigmoid()` — quintic C2-continuous smoothstep for optional smooth blending
- `compute_muscle_params()` — build-time computation of `lengthrange`, `acc0`,
  and auto-resolved `F0 = scale / acc0`

Model fields: `actuator_dynprm[3]`, `actuator_gainprm[9]`, `actuator_biasprm[9]`,
`actuator_lengthrange`, `actuator_acc0`. Data fields: `actuator_length`,
`actuator_velocity`, `actuator_force`, `act_dot`, RK4 scratch buffers.

17 tests covering all 15 acceptance criteria (see [future_work_1 #5](./todo/future_work_1.md)).

**Standalone implementation in `sim-muscle` crate (richer Hill-type model):**

Created a comprehensive Hill-type muscle-tendon unit (MTU) model for biomechanical simulation:

**Activation Dynamics (`activation.rs`):**
- First-order excitation-to-activation filter with asymmetric time constants
- Faster activation (τ_act ≈ 10-20 ms) than deactivation (τ_deact ≈ 40-80 ms)
- Presets for fast-twitch (`ActivationDynamics::fast_twitch()`) and slow-twitch (`ActivationDynamics::slow_twitch()`)
- Semi-implicit Euler integration for unconditional stability

**Force Curves (`curves.rs`):**
- `ActiveForceLengthCurve` - Bell-shaped curve centered at optimal fiber length
- `PassiveForceLengthCurve` - Exponential rise at long lengths (connective tissue)
- `ForceVelocityCurve` - Hill hyperbolic relationship for concentric/eccentric
- `MuscleForceCurves` - Combined evaluation of all three relationships

**Hill Muscle Model (`hill.rs`):**
- `HillMuscle` - Complete muscle-tendon unit with state management
- `HillMuscleConfig` - Configurable parameters (F_max, L_opt, L_slack, etc.)
- Pennation angle effects with constant-width assumption
- Rigid tendon (fast) and compliant tendon (accurate) modes
- Predefined configurations: `biceps()`, `quadriceps()`, `gastrocnemius()`, `soleus()`

**Kinematics (`kinematics.rs`):**
- `ConstantMomentArm` - Fixed lever arm
- `PolynomialMomentArm` - r(θ) as polynomial function
- `SplineMomentArm` - Interpolation from measured data
- `BiarticularMuscleConfig` - Two-joint muscles (e.g., rectus femoris)
- `MusclePath` - Via points and wrapping support (geometry only)

**`MuscleActuator` trait** (in sim-muscle `lib.rs`, not sim-constraint):
- Common interface for muscle models

**Integration with sim-constraint (optional `muscle` feature):**
- `MuscleJoint` - RevoluteJoint with muscle group actuation
- `MuscleJointBuilder` - Builder pattern for agonist/antagonist pairs
- `MuscleCommands` - Command storage for RL interfaces

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_muscle::{HillMuscle, HillMuscleConfig, MuscleGroup};
use sim_constraint::{MuscleJoint, RevoluteJoint}; // with "muscle" feature

// Create biceps muscle
let biceps = HillMuscle::new(HillMuscleConfig::biceps())
    .with_name("biceps_brachii");

// Create triceps muscle
let triceps = HillMuscle::new(HillMuscleConfig::default())
    .with_name("triceps_brachii");

// Build muscle group (agonist/antagonist pair)
let muscles = MuscleGroup::new()
    .with_flexor(biceps)
    .with_extensor(triceps);

// Attach to joint
let base_joint = RevoluteJoint::new(BodyId::new(0), BodyId::new(1), Vector3::z());
let mut elbow = MuscleJoint::new(base_joint, muscles);

// Control via excitation (0-1)
elbow.set_muscle_excitation(0, 0.8);  // Activate biceps
elbow.set_muscle_excitation(1, 0.2);  // Partial triceps

// Compute joint torque
let torque = elbow.compute_joint_force(velocity, dt);
```

- `sim-muscle/src/activation.rs` - Activation dynamics
- `sim-muscle/src/curves.rs` - Force-length-velocity relationships
- `sim-muscle/src/hill.rs` - Hill muscle model
- `sim-muscle/src/kinematics.rs` - Moment arm models

> **Two sensor systems exist.** The sim-sensor crate has standalone `Imu`, `ForceTorqueSensor`, `TouchSensor`, `Rangefinder`, and `Magnetometer` implementations that operate on `RigidBodyState` objects. The MuJoCo pipeline has its own sensor readout in `mj_sensor_pos()`/`mj_sensor_vel()`/`mj_sensor_acc()` within `mujoco_pipeline.rs`. All 32 pipeline sensor types are functional and fully wired from MJCF `<sensor>` elements via `process_sensors()` in `model_builder.rs` ([future_work_1 #6](./todo/future_work_1.md)). The MJCF parser recognizes 32 `MjcfSensorType` variants; all 32 map to pipeline `MjSensorType`. JointLimitFrc and TendonLimitFrc read cached penalty force magnitudes from `mj_fwd_constraint()`. `set_options()` propagates `magnetic`, `wind`, `density`, and `viscosity` from MJCF `<option>`. Magnetometer is evaluated in the Position stage (depends only on `site_xmat` from FK). ActuatorVel reads from pre-computed `data.actuator_velocity`.

### Implementation Notes: Sensors ✅ COMPLETED (both standalone sim-sensor crate and pipeline sensors)

Created `sim-sensor` crate with:
- `Imu` - Accelerometer + gyroscope combined sensor with configurable noise, bias, and gravity
- `ForceTorqueSensor` - 6-axis force/torque measurement with saturation and deadband
- `TouchSensor` - Contact detection with force thresholds and body filtering
- `SensorObservation` in sim-types for integration with observation system

**Example usage:**
```rust
use sim_sensor::{Imu, ImuConfig, TouchSensor, TouchSensorConfig};
use sim_types::{BodyId, ContactInfo, RigidBodyState, Pose};

// Create an IMU on body 1
let imu = Imu::new(BodyId::new(1), ImuConfig::default());
let state = RigidBodyState::at_rest(Pose::identity());
let reading = imu.read_from_state(&state, 0.001);

// Create a touch sensor
let touch = TouchSensor::new(BodyId::new(1), TouchSensorConfig::default());
let contacts: Vec<ContactInfo> = vec![];
let obs = touch.read_as_observation(&contacts, 0.001);
```

**Files:** `sim-sensor/src/imu.rs`, `sim-sensor/src/force_torque.rs`, `sim-sensor/src/touch.rs`, `sim-sensor/src/rangefinder.rs`, `sim-sensor/src/magnetometer.rs`

**New crate:** `sim-sensor/`

## 9. Tendons

| Feature | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| Fixed tendons | Yes | `FixedTendon` | ✅ **Pipeline** — `mj_fwd_tendon_fixed()`, full kinematics/actuation/passive/constraints | - | - |
| Spatial tendons | Yes | `SpatialTendon` | ✅ **Pipeline** — `mj_fwd_tendon_spatial()`, 3D routing, Jacobian via `accumulate_point_jacobian()`, passive/constraints/actuation | - | - |
| Wrapping (sphere/cylinder) | Yes | `sphere_wrap`, `cylinder_wrap` | ✅ **Pipeline** — dual-candidate tangent selection, sidesite disambiguation, helical arc length | - | - |
| Pulley systems | Yes | Pulley divisor | ✅ **Pipeline** — `WrapType::Pulley` pair-skip, length/Jacobian scaling by divisor | - | - |

> **Both fixed and spatial tendons are fully integrated into the pipeline.** The model builder (`process_tendons()`) converts MJCF `<tendon><fixed>` and `<tendon><spatial>` elements into pipeline Model arrays. `mj_fwd_tendon()` computes tendon lengths and Jacobians in `mj_fwd_position()` (fixed via linear coupling, spatial via 3D pairwise routing with `accumulate_point_jacobian()`), tendon velocities in `mj_fwd_velocity()`, passive forces (spring/damper/friction) in `mj_fwd_passive()`, limit constraints in `mj_fwd_constraint()`, and actuation via J^T mapping in `mj_fwd_actuation()`. Spatial tendons support sphere and cylinder wrapping (`sphere_wrap`, `cylinder_wrap`), sidesite disambiguation, pulley divisors, and free-joint Jacobians. All tendon sensor types (TendonPos/TendonVel/ActuatorPos/ActuatorVel) read live tendon data. See [future_work_1 #4](./todo/future_work_1.md), [future_work_2 #4](./todo/future_work_2.md).

### Implementation Notes: Connect (Ball) Constraint ✅ COMPLETED

The connect (ball) constraint enforces that two attachment points (one on each body) coincide in 3D space. It acts like a ball-and-socket joint without any rotational constraints - both bodies can rotate freely around the connection point.

**Constraint Formulation:**
```
p1 + R1 * anchor - p2 = 0
```

Where:
- `p1`, `p2` are the body positions
- `R1` is the rotation matrix of body1
- `anchor` is the local anchor point in body1's frame

This results in 3 scalar constraints (one per axis).

**Implementation:**
- `ConnectConstraint` - Ball constraint between two bodies or body-to-world
- `MjcfConnect` - MJCF representation for `<connect>` element parsing
- `MjcfEquality` - Container for equality constraints in MJCF model
- Full MJCF parser support for `<equality><connect>` elements
- Baumgarte stabilization for position correction
- Compliance and damping parameters for soft constraints
- Solver reference (`solref`) and impedance (`solimp`) parameters

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_constraint::ConnectConstraint;
use sim_types::BodyId;
use nalgebra::Vector3;

// Connect body1's tip to body2's origin
let constraint = ConnectConstraint::new(
    BodyId::new(0),
    BodyId::new(1),
    Vector3::new(0.0, 0.0, 1.0),  // anchor at body1's +Z tip
);

// Connect body to world (fixed point constraint)
let world_constraint = ConnectConstraint::to_world(
    BodyId::new(0),
    Vector3::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
);

// Via MJCF
let mjcf = r#"
    <mujoco model="test">
        <worldbody>
            <body name="body1"/>
            <body name="body2"/>
        </worldbody>
        <equality>
            <connect name="ball" body1="body1" body2="body2" anchor="0.5 0 0"/>
        </equality>
    </mujoco>
"#;
let model = sim_mjcf::parse_mjcf_str(mjcf).expect("should parse");
// model.equality.connects contains the parsed constraints
```

**Files:**
- `sim-constraint/src/equality.rs` - `ConnectConstraint` implementation
- `sim-mjcf/src/types.rs` - `MjcfConnect`, `MjcfEquality` types
- `sim-mjcf/src/parser.rs` - `<equality>` and `<connect>` element parsing

## 11. Deformables (Flex)

| Feature | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Priority | Complexity |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|------------|
| 1D (capsule chains) | Yes | `CapsuleChain` | ✅ **Pipeline** (XPBD + deformable-rigid contact) | - | - |
| 2D (triangle shells) | Yes | `Cloth` | ✅ **Pipeline** (XPBD + deformable-rigid contact) | - | - |
| 3D (tetrahedra) | Yes | `SoftBody` | ✅ **Pipeline** (XPBD + deformable-rigid contact) | - | - |
| Skinned meshes | Yes | `SkinnedMesh` | **Standalone** (visual deformation only, not in contact pipeline) | - | - |
| Deformable-rigid collision | Yes | `CollisionConstraint`, `DeformableContact` | ✅ **Implemented** (vertex-vs-geom narrowphase: plane/sphere/box/capsule/cylinder/ellipsoid) | - | - |

> ✅ **Pipeline-integrated via split-solve approach.** Deformable bodies registered via `Data::register_deformable()` participate in collision detection (`mj_deformable_collision()`) and contact resolution (`solve_deformable_contacts()`) with rigid geoms. XPBD internal constraints solved via `mj_deformable_step()` in both Euler and RK4 integrators. Feature-gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "deformable")]` for zero overhead when disabled. See [future_work_4 #11](./todo/future_work_4.md) ✅.

## 12. Performance Optimizations

| Feature | MuJoCo | CortenForge | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Sparse matrix ops | Native | `SparseJacobian`, `JacobianBuilder` (was in `sparse.rs`) | **Removed** (Phase 3 consolidation) | - |
| Sleeping bodies | Native | `mj_sleep`, `mj_wake*`, `mj_island`, selective CRBA, partial LDL | **Implemented** (Phases A/B/C — 93 tests; [future_work_5 §16](./todo/future_work_5.md)) | - |
| Constraint islands | Auto | `mj_island` (DFS flood-fill in pipeline) + `mj_fwd_constraint_islands` (per-island solving) | **Implemented** (pipeline island discovery + block-diagonal solving) | - |
| **Multi-threading** | Model-data separation | `parallel` feature with rayon | **Active** — `BatchSim::step_all()` uses `par_iter_mut` for cross-environment parallelism (`batch.rs`); see [future_work_3 #9](./todo/future_work_3.md) | - |
| **GPU acceleration** | MuJoCo MJX (JAX) | `sim-gpu` crate (wgpu) | **Active (Phase 10a)** — `GpuBatchSim` offloads Euler velocity integration to GPU compute shader; full pipeline stays on CPU. See [future_work_3 #10](./todo/future_work_3.md) | - |
| SIMD | Likely | `sim-simd` crate | **Partial** (only `find_max_dot()` is used by sim-core GJK; all other batch ops have zero callers outside benchmarks) | - |

### Implementation Notes: SIMD Optimization ⚠️ PARTIAL (crate complete; only `find_max_dot` has production callers)

The `sim-simd` crate provides explicit SIMD vectorization for hot paths in the physics
simulation stack. It processes multiple vectors simultaneously using batch operations
optimized for modern CPU SIMD instructions (AVX/AVX2, AVX-512, NEON).

**Key Types:**
- `Vec3x4` - Process 4 `Vector3<f64>` values simultaneously (256-bit)
- `Vec3x8` - Process 8 `Vector3<f64>` values simultaneously (512-bit)

**Hot Paths Optimized:**

1. **GJK Support Vertex Search** (`sim-core/src/gjk_epa.rs`):
   - Batch dot products for finding support vertices in convex meshes
   - Uses `find_max_dot()` to process vertices in groups of 4-8
   - 2-4x speedup for meshes with >16 vertices

2. **Contact Force Computation** (removed — formerly `sim-contact/src/batch.rs`):
   - `BatchContactProcessor` has been removed (was in `sim-contact`)
   - Contact types (`ContactPoint`, `ContactManifold`, `ContactForce`) now live in `sim-core`

3. **AABB Overlap Testing** (`sim-simd/src/batch_ops.rs`):
   - `batch_aabb_overlap_4()` tests 4 AABB pairs at once
   - Useful for broad-phase collision detection

**Usage:**

```rust
use sim_simd::{Vec3x4, find_max_dot, batch_dot_product_4};
use nalgebra::Vector3;

// Batch dot products
let vectors = [
    Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    Vector3::new(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),
    Vector3::new(0.0, 0.0, 1.0),
    Vector3::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
];
let direction = Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
let dots = batch_dot_product_4(&vectors, &direction);

// Find support vertex (GJK)
let vertices = vec![/* many vertices */];
let (idx, max_dot) = find_max_dot(&vertices, &direction);

// Contact types now in sim-core
use sim_core::{ContactPoint, ContactManifold, ContactForce};
```

**Performance Notes:**
- On modern x86-64 (AVX2): expect 2-4x speedup for batch operations
- On Apple Silicon (NEON): expect 2-3x speedup
- Scalar fallback available when remainder doesn't fill a batch

**Files:** `sim-simd/src/`, `sim-core/src/gjk_epa.rs` (batch contact processor removed; contact types now in `sim-core`)

### Implementation Notes: Multi-threading ✅ ACTIVE (cross-environment parallelism via BatchSim)

The `parallel` feature enables cross-environment parallelism via `BatchSim::step_all()`,
which uses rayon's `par_iter_mut` to step multiple simulation environments concurrently.

> **History:** An earlier island-parallel constraint solving implementation
> (`sim-constraint/src/parallel.rs`, `newton.rs`) was removed in Phase 3
> consolidation. Island-based solving is now handled natively by the pipeline
> via `mj_fwd_constraint_islands()` (sequential per-island decomposition
> within each environment step).

**Current implementation:**
- `BatchSim::step_all()` in `sim-core/src/batch.rs` — rayon `par_iter_mut` over environments
- `GpuBatchSim::step_all()` in `sim-gpu` — parallel CPU forward pass + GPU velocity integration

**Files:** `sim-core/src/batch.rs` (BatchSim), `sim-types/src/config.rs` (ParallelConfig)

### Implementation Notes: GPU Acceleration ✅ ACTIVE (Phase 10a — Euler velocity integration)

The `sim-gpu` crate (`sim/L0/gpu/`) provides GPU-accelerated batched simulation
via wgpu compute shaders. `GpuBatchSim` is a drop-in replacement for `BatchSim`
with the same API surface (step_all, reset, env/env_mut, len, model).

**Phase 10a scope:** Only the Euler velocity integration (`qvel += qacc * h`)
runs on GPU. All other pipeline stages (FK, collision, constraints, dynamics)
remain on CPU. This validates the full GPU infrastructure with minimal physics
complexity.

**Architecture:**
- `GpuSimContext` — `OnceLock<Option<>>` singleton for wgpu device/queue (follows `mesh-gpu` pattern)
- `GpuEnvBuffers` — Structure-of-Arrays f32 GPU buffers (qvel, qacc, staging) with overflow-safe size validation
- `GpuParams` — `#[repr(C)]` Pod+Zeroable uniform buffer matching WGSL struct layout (16 bytes)
- `euler_integrate.wgsl` — compute shader with pipeline-overridable `wg_size` and strided loop for nv > wg_size

**5-step pipeline per timestep:**
1. CPU: `data.forward(&model)` for each env (rayon-parallel with `parallel` feature)
2. CPU→GPU: Upload qvel + qacc as f32 SoA buffers (`queue.write_buffer`)
3. GPU: `euler_integrate` compute shader (one workgroup per env, one thread per DOF)
4. GPU→CPU: Staging buffer readback via `map_async` + `device.poll(Wait)`
5. CPU: Activation integration + position integration + time advance (`integrate_without_velocity`)

**sim-core integration:** Three feature-gated helpers exposed behind `gpu-internals`:
- `Data::integrate_without_velocity()` — skips velocity update (done on GPU)
- `BatchSim::envs_as_mut_slice()` — for rayon `par_iter_mut` in GPU forward pass
- `BatchSim::model_arc()` — for `Arc::clone` in parallel forward pass

**Fallback:** `GpuBatchSim::try_new()` returns `Ok(None)` when no GPU is available;
other errors (`UnsupportedIntegrator`, `BatchTooLarge`) are propagated.

**Remaining phases (10b–10f):** FK, collision broad/narrow phase, constraint solver,
full GPU step. See [future_work_3 #10](./todo/future_work_3.md).

**Files:** `sim-gpu/src/` (pipeline.rs, context.rs, buffers.rs, error.rs, shaders/euler_integrate.wgsl), `sim-gpu/tests/integration.rs`, `sim-gpu/benches/gpu_benchmarks.rs`

### Implementation Notes: Sleeping / Body Deactivation ✅ COMPLETE (Phases A/B/C — 93 tests)

Tree-based sleeping system matching MuJoCo's `mj_checkSleep` / `mj_island` architecture.
Three phases fully implemented with 93 integration tests in `sleeping.rs`.

> **History:** An earlier sleeping implementation existed in the old World/Stepper architecture
> (`Body::is_sleeping`, `put_to_sleep()`, `wake_up()`). It was removed during the Model/Data
> refactor. The current implementation is a ground-up redesign for the MuJoCo pipeline.

**Phase A — Per-tree sleeping:**
- Kinematic tree enumeration (`ntree`, `tree_body_adr`, `tree_dof_adr`, etc.)
- Sleep policy resolution (Auto→AutoNever/AutoAllowed, user Never/Allowed/Init)
- Sleep countdown timer (`tree_asleep`), velocity threshold check (`sleep_tolerance * dof_length`)
- Wake detection: user forces (bytewise check), contact, `tree_qpos_dirty`
- Pipeline skip logic: FK, collision, velocity, passive forces, integration, sensors
- RK4 guard (sleep disabled for RK4, warning emitted)

**Phase B — Island discovery and cross-tree coupling:**
- `mj_island()`: DFS flood-fill over tree-tree adjacency graph (contact/tendon/equality)
- Sleep-cycle linked list (`tree_asleep[t] >= 0` encodes linked list)
- Cross-island wake: `mj_wake_tendon()`, `mj_wake_equality()`, `mj_wake_collision()`
- qpos change detection (`tree_qpos_dirty` flags, `mj_check_qpos_changed()`)
- Per-island block-diagonal constraint solving (`mj_fwd_constraint_islands`)
- Union-find validation for `sleep="init"` trees
- `dof_length` mechanism length computation for non-uniform thresholds

**Phase C — Performance optimization:**
- Awake-index indirection: `body_awake_ind`, `dof_awake_ind`, `parent_awake_ind` for O(awake) loops
- Island-local Delassus assembly: small per-island mass matrices for multi-island scenes
- Selective CRBA: skip sleeping subtrees in composite-inertia accumulation
- Partial LDL: `mj_factor_sparse_selective` factorizes only awake DOF blocks;
  sleeping DOFs retain last-awake `qM`/`qLD` values (tree independence)

**Key functions:** `mj_sleep()`, `mj_wake()`, `mj_wake_collision()`, `mj_wake_tendon()`,
`mj_wake_equality()`, `mj_island()`, `mj_fwd_constraint_islands()`, `mj_update_sleep_arrays()`,
`mj_factor_sparse_selective()`, `reset_sleep_state()`

**Files:** `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs` (implementation), `sim/L0/tests/integration/sleeping.rs` (93 tests),
`sim/L0/mjcf/src/model_builder.rs` (MJCF parsing for sleep attributes)

| MJB (binary) | Native | `sim-mjcf` crate (mjb feature) | **Implemented** | - |

### Implementation Notes: MJB Binary Format ✅ COMPLETED

MJB is a binary serialization format for MJCF models providing:
- Faster loading than XML parsing
- Pre-serialized model data ready for deserialization
- Reduced file sizes through binary encoding

**Implementation:**
- `save_mjb_file()` / `save_mjb_bytes()` / `save_mjb_writer()` - Serialize `MjcfModel` to binary
- `load_mjb_file()` / `load_mjb_bytes()` / `load_mjb_reader()` - Deserialize from binary
- `is_mjb_file()` / `is_mjb_bytes()` - Check if data is valid MJB format
- `MjbHeader` - File header with magic bytes, version, and flags

**File Format:**
1. Magic bytes: `MJB1` (4 bytes)
2. Version: `u32` little-endian (4 bytes) - currently version 1
3. Flags: `u32` little-endian (4 bytes) - reserved for future use
4. Payload: bincode-encoded `MjcfModel` data

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_mjcf::{parse_mjcf_str, load_mjb_file, save_mjb_file};

// Parse MJCF and save to binary for faster loading later
let model = parse_mjcf_str("<mujoco><worldbody/></mujoco>").unwrap();
save_mjb_file(&model, "model.mjb").unwrap();

// Load from binary (much faster than XML parsing)
let loaded = load_mjb_file("model.mjb").unwrap();
```

**Feature Flag:** Requires `mjb` feature to be enabled:
```toml
[dependencies]
sim-mjcf = { workspace = true, features = ["mjb"] }
```

## Priority Roadmap

### ⚠️ Status: Partially Complete (January 2026)

> **The authoritative roadmap is [`sim/docs/todo/index.md`](./todo/index.md)**, which covers Phase 1 (12 items, all complete) and Phase 2 (16 items, #17 dropped) with verified code references and acceptance criteria. The phases below reflect historical development milestones. Features marked with ⚠️ were later removed or remain standalone (not wired into the pipeline).

The following were completed in January 2026:

| Feature | Section | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Non-convex mesh collision | §5 Geoms | `CollisionShape::TriangleMesh` with BVH acceleration |
| SDF collision | §5 Geoms | All 10 shape combinations implemented |
| MJCF `<default>` element | §13 Model Format | ✅ `DefaultResolver` wired into `model_builder.rs` for all element types |
| MJCF `<tendon>` parsing | §13 Model Format | Spatial and fixed tendons |
| MJCF `<sensor>` parsing + wiring | §13 Model Format | 32 `MjcfSensorType` variants parsed; all 32 wired to pipeline via `process_sensors()` |

See [future_work_1.md](./todo/future_work_1.md) for remaining items.

### ✅ Multi-threading (constraint-parallel removed; cross-env parallelism active)

The `parallel` feature originally enabled multi-threaded constraint solving and body integration.
Standalone island-parallel constraint solving (`solve_islands_parallel()` and `islands.rs`) were removed in Phase 3 consolidation. The rayon dependency and `parallel` feature flag are now used by `BatchSim::step_all()` for cross-environment parallelism ([future_work_3 #9](./todo/future_work_3.md)). Note: the Newton solver was not removed — it was reimplemented as pipeline-native `newton_solve()` (§15).

**Files:** `sim-core/src/batch.rs` (BatchSim), `sim-types/src/config.rs` (ParallelConfig). Removed: `sim-constraint/src/parallel.rs`, `sim-core/src/world.rs`, `sim-core/src/stepper.rs`

### ✅ Recently Completed: MJB Binary Format

MJB binary format support added to `sim-mjcf` crate (requires `mjb` feature):
- `save_mjb_file()` / `load_mjb_file()` - Serialize/deserialize models to/from binary files
- `save_mjb_bytes()` / `load_mjb_bytes()` - In-memory binary serialization
- `is_mjb_file()` / `is_mjb_bytes()` - Format detection
- File format: magic bytes (`MJB1`) + version + flags + bincode-encoded `MjcfModel`

### ✅ Previously Completed: Free Joint (pipeline); Standalone Extensions

- **FreeJoint**: 6 DOF floating base for quadrupeds, humanoids, drones — fully in pipeline `MjJointType`
- **UniversalJoint**: 2 DOF — standalone in sim-constraint (not a MuJoCo type)
- **PlanarJoint**: 3 DOF for mobile robots — standalone in sim-constraint (not a MuJoCo type)
- **CylindricalJoint**: 2 DOF for screw mechanisms — standalone in sim-constraint (not a MuJoCo type)

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Parity (COMPLETED)

1. ~~**Collision shapes**: Box-box, box-sphere, capsule detection~~ ✅
2. ~~**Broad-phase**: Sweep-and-prune or BVH integration~~ ✅
3. ~~**Elliptic friction cones**: Replace circular with elliptic~~ ✅ (full elliptic cones with variable condim 1/3/4/6 in PGS/CG solvers)
4. ~~**Sensors**: IMU, force/torque, touch sensors~~ ✅ (sim-sensor crate standalone + 32 pipeline sensor types functional)
5. ~~**Implicit integration**: Implicit-in-velocity method~~ ✅

### ⚠️ Phase 2: Solver Improvements (built then partially removed)

1. ~~**Newton solver**: For faster convergence~~ ✅ Standalone removed → ✅ **Reimplemented** (pipeline-native `newton_solve()` — reduced primal formulation, §15)
2. ~~**Constraint islands**: For performance~~ ✅ → ⚠️ **Removed** (Phase 3 consolidation) → ✅ **Reimplemented** (pipeline-native `mj_island()` + `mj_fwd_constraint_islands()` as part of sleeping system)
3. ~~**Sleeping**: Deactivate stationary bodies~~ ✅ **Pipeline** (tree-based sleeping with island discovery, selective CRBA, partial LDL, per-island solving — 93 tests; [future_work_5 §16](./todo/future_work_5.md))
4. ~~**GJK/EPA**: For convex mesh collision~~ ✅

### ⚠️ Phase 3: Extended Features (standalone crates built, not in pipeline)

1. ~~**MJCF loading**: For MuJoCo model compatibility~~ ✅
2. ~~**Muscle actuators**: For biomechanics~~ ✅ **Pipeline** (MuJoCo FLV model in `mj_fwd_actuation()` with activation dynamics, control/force clamping; sim-muscle crate provides richer standalone Hill-type model; see [future_work_1 #5](./todo/future_work_1.md) ✅)
3. ~~**Tendons**: For cable robots~~ ✅ **Pipeline** (fixed + spatial tendons fully integrated, including sphere/cylinder wrapping, sidesite, pulley; see [future_work_1 #4](./todo/future_work_1.md), [future_work_2 #4](./todo/future_work_2.md))
4. ~~**Deformables**: For soft body simulation~~ ✅ **Pipeline** (split-solve deformable-rigid contact + XPBD; see [future_work_4 #11](./todo/future_work_4.md) ✅)

### ⚠️ Phase 4: Solver & Performance (built then partially removed)

Focus: Internal solver improvements for better performance.

1. ~~**Sparse matrix operations**: CSR/CSC matrices for constraint Jacobians~~ ✅ → ⚠️ **Removed** (Phase 3 consolidation — `sparse.rs` deleted, never used by pipeline)
2. ~~**Warm starting**: Initialize from previous frame's solution~~ ✅ (pipeline PGS has its own warm starting)
3. ~~**Implicit-fast (no Coriolis)**: Skip Coriolis terms for performance~~ — Standalone removed (`integrators.rs` deleted in FUTURE_WORK C1); **re-implemented** as pipeline `Integrator::ImplicitFast` (symmetric D, Cholesky) + `Integrator::Implicit` (asymmetric D + Coriolis, LU) in §13

**Implemented:**

**Sparse Matrix Operations (`sim-constraint/src/sparse.rs` — removed in Phase 3 consolidation):**
- `SparseJacobian` - CSR format for efficient J*v and J^T*v operations
- `SparseEffectiveMass` - CSC format for Cholesky factorization
- `JacobianBuilder` - Triplet accumulation for building sparse matrices
- `InvMassBlock` - Efficient 6x6 inverse mass/inertia storage
- Automatic dense/sparse switching based on system size (threshold: 16 bodies)

**Warm Starting (pipeline-native):**
- `WarmstartKey` spatial hash (1cm grid) in pipeline PGS — `efc_lambda: HashMap<WarmstartKey, Vec<f64>>`
- Enabled by `<flag warmstart="true"/>` (default)
- Standalone `NewtonSolverConfig::warm_starting` was removed in Phase 3 consolidation

**Implicit-Fast Integration (re-implemented in §13):**
- The standalone `ImplicitFast` integrator and its `IntegrationMethod::ImplicitFast`
  dispatch variant were removed in FUTURE_WORK C1 (dead code — not called by
  the pipeline). Re-implemented as `Integrator::ImplicitFast` in §13 with
  full velocity-derivative Jacobian assembly and Cholesky factorization.
  `Integrator::Implicit` (LU, with Coriolis) also added.

**Files (removed in consolidation):**
- `sim-constraint/src/sparse.rs` — removed in Phase 3
- `sim-constraint/src/newton.rs` — removed in Phase 3
- `sim-core/src/integrators.rs` — removed in FUTURE_WORK C1

### Phase 5: Collision Completeness ✅ COMPLETED

Focus: All collision detection improvements, primarily in sim-core.

| Feature | Section | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| ~~Cylinder collision shape~~ | §4 Collision, §5 Geoms | Medium | ✅ Native cylinder support with GJK/EPA |

**Implemented:**

**Cylinder Collision Shape (`sim-core/src/collision_shape.rs`, `gjk_epa.rs`):**
- `CollisionShape::Cylinder { half_length, radius }` - Flat-capped cylinder
- `CollisionShape::cylinder(half_length, radius)` - Constructor
- `support_cylinder()` - GJK support function with proper local direction handling
- Tight AABB computation accounting for rotation
- All collision pairs routed through GJK/EPA

**Ellipsoid Collision Shape (`sim-core/src/collision_shape.rs`, `gjk_epa.rs`):**
- `CollisionShape::Ellipsoid { radii }` - Axis-aligned ellipsoid
- `CollisionShape::ellipsoid(radii)`, `ellipsoid_xyz(rx, ry, rz)` - Constructors
- `support_ellipsoid()` - GJK support function using normalized gradient
- AABB computation via rotation matrix column projection
- All collision pairs routed through GJK/EPA

**Mid-Phase BVH (`sim-core/src/mid_phase.rs`):**
- `Bvh` - Top-down AABB tree for triangle meshes
- `BvhPrimitive` - Stores AABB, index, and user data per primitive
- `BvhNode` - Internal (with children) or leaf (with primitives)
- `Bvh::build()` - Top-down construction with median splitting
- `Bvh::query()` - Find all primitives overlapping an AABB
- `Bvh::query_pairs()` - Self-intersection query
- `bvh_from_triangle_mesh()` - Helper for building from triangle soup
- Configurable `max_primitives_per_leaf` (default: 4)

**Contact Pairs Filtering (MuJoCo pipeline):**
- `geom_contype: Vec<u32>` - Geom collision type bitmask (in `Model`)
- `geom_conaffinity: Vec<u32>` - Geom affinity bitmask (in `Model`)
- Check: `(a.contype & b.conaffinity) != 0 && (b.contype & a.conaffinity) != 0`
- Defaults: `contype = 1`, `conaffinity = 1` (everything collides)

**MJCF Model Builder Updates (`sim-mjcf/src/model_builder.rs`):**
- Transfer `contype`/`conaffinity` from MJCF geoms to Model arrays
- Native `CollisionShape::Cylinder` for MJCF cylinders (no longer approximated)
- Native `CollisionShape::Ellipsoid` for MJCF ellipsoids

**Files:** `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs`, `sim-core/src/gjk_epa.rs`, `sim-core/src/mid_phase.rs`, `sim-mjcf/src/model_builder.rs`

### Phase 6: Contact Physics ✅ RE-IMPLEMENTED

Focus: Advanced friction models — **originally implemented in sim-contact, removed in Phase 3 consolidation, then re-implemented directly in the pipeline** with full variable-dimension support.

| Feature | Section | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| ~~Torsional friction~~ | §3 Contact | Medium | ✅ **Implemented** (`Contact.mu[2]`, angular Jacobian row 3, `apply_contact_torque()`) |
| ~~Rolling friction~~ | §3 Contact | High | ✅ **Implemented** (`Contact.mu[3..5]`, angular Jacobian rows 4-5, `apply_contact_torque()`) |
| ~~Pyramidal friction cones~~ | §3 Contact | Low | ⚠️ **Stub** (warning emitted, falls back to elliptic — requires different system size) |

**Implemented (in `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs`):**

**Variable Contact Dimensions:**
- `Contact.dim: usize` — Contact dimensionality (1, 3, 4, or 6)
- `Contact.mu: [f64; 5]` — Friction coefficients [sliding1, sliding2, torsional, rolling1, rolling2]
- `efc_offsets: Vec<usize>` — Starting row for each contact in the constraint system
- Variable-length warmstart with `HashMap<WarmstartKey, Vec<f64>>`

**Elliptic Friction Cone Projection (`project_elliptic_cone()`):**
- Two-step physically-correct projection:
  1. Enforce unilateral constraint (λ_n ≥ 0, else release contact)
  2. Scale friction components to cone boundary if `||(λ_i/μ_i)|| > λ_n`
- Handles per-direction friction coefficients for anisotropic friction
- Zero-mu components clamped without affecting others

**Dispatcher (`project_friction_cone()`):**
- Routes to appropriate projection based on contact dimension
- condim 1: Normal only (frictionless)
- condim 3: Normal + 2D tangential (sliding friction)
- condim 4: condim 3 + torsional (spinning resistance)
- condim 6: condim 4 + rolling (full MuJoCo model)

**Torsional Friction (condim ≥ 4):**
- Angular Jacobian row 3: `J_ω[0..3] = contact_normal`
- Torque applied via `apply_contact_torque()` using `Contact.mu[2]`
- Opposes rotation about the contact normal (spinning)

**Rolling Friction (condim = 6):**
- Angular Jacobian rows 4-5: perpendicular to contact normal
- Torques applied via `apply_contact_torque()` using `Contact.mu[3..5]`
- Opposes rotation perpendicular to the contact normal

**Torque Application (`apply_contact_torque()`):**
```rust
// Apply torsional/rolling friction torques to body angular accelerations
fn apply_contact_torque(data: &mut Data, contact: &Contact, lambda: &[f64]) {
    // Torsional (row 3): torque about contact normal
    if contact.dim >= 4 && lambda.len() > 3 {
        let torque = contact.normal * lambda[3];
        // Apply to both bodies with opposite signs...
    }
    // Rolling (rows 4-5): torque perpendicular to normal
    if contact.dim == 6 && lambda.len() > 5 {
        let tangent1 = contact.frame.col(0);
        let tangent2 = contact.frame.col(1);
        let torque = tangent1 * lambda[4] + tangent2 * lambda[5];
        // Apply to both bodies with opposite signs...
    }
}
```

**Files:**
- `sim-core/src/mujoco_pipeline.rs` — `project_elliptic_cone()`, `project_friction_cone()`, `apply_contact_torque()`, PGS/CG solvers
- `sim-core/src/contact.rs` — `Contact` struct with `dim`, `mu`, `frame` fields
- Formerly `sim-contact/src/friction.rs`, `sim-contact/src/model.rs` — removed in Phase 3 consolidation, re-implemented in pipeline

### Phase 7: Actuators & Control ⚠️ STANDALONE (sim-constraint only — not in pipeline)

Focus: New actuator types and joint coupling in sim-constraint. **All items are standalone** — pipeline `mj_fwd_actuation()` has full gain/bias processing for all actuator types (GainType/BiasType dispatch, FLV curves for muscles, Fixed/Affine gain/bias for non-muscle types, FilterExact dynamics).

| Feature | Section | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| ~~Integrated velocity actuator~~ | §7 Actuators | Low | ✅ → ⚠️ **Standalone** (sim-constraint; pipeline has its own velocity actuator via gain/bias) |
| ~~General custom actuator~~ | §7 Actuators | Medium | ✅ → ⚠️ **Standalone** (sim-constraint; pipeline has its own general actuator via GainType/BiasType) |
| ~~Pneumatic cylinder actuator~~ | §7 Actuators | Medium | ✅ → ⚠️ **Standalone** (sim-constraint; pipeline has its own cylinder actuator via gain/bias + Filter dynamics) |

### Phase 9: Advanced Features (Partially Complete)

| Feature | Section | Complexity | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|--------|-------|
| ~~Height field collision~~ | §4 Collision, §5 Geoms | High | ✅ COMPLETED | Terrain simulation |
| ~~Conjugate Gradient solver~~ | §2 Solvers | Medium | ✅ COMPLETED | Pipeline CG in `mujoco_pipeline.rs` (`cg_solve_contacts()`); `CGSolver` in sim-constraint remains standalone joint-space solver (see FUTURE_WORK #3 ✅) |
| ~~Tendon coupling constraints~~ | §10 Equality | Low | ✅ COMPLETED → ⚠️ **Standalone** | In sim-constraint; pipeline tendon *equality* constraints not yet implemented (tendon kinematics/actuation/limits ARE in pipeline) |

| ~~MJB binary format~~ | §13 Model Format | Low | ✅ **COMPLETED** | Faster loading via bincode serialization |

**Implemented (some now standalone or removed — see table above for current status):**

> **⚠️ Note:** The `CGSolver` below is standalone (`sim-constraint`), operating on joint-space constraints via the `Joint` trait. The pipeline's contact CG solver (`cg_solve_contacts()` in `mujoco_pipeline.rs`) is a separate implementation using PGD with Barzilai-Borwein step. Tendon *equality* constraints (`TendonConstraint`) are in `sim-constraint` and not used by the pipeline (the pipeline handles tendon kinematics, actuation, limits, and passive forces directly). Island-parallel solving was removed in Phase 3 consolidation.

**Conjugate Gradient Solver (`sim-constraint/src/cg.rs`) — ⚠️ Standalone:**
- `CGSolver` - Conjugate gradient method for constraint solving
- `CGSolverConfig` - Configurable tolerance, max iterations, Baumgarte stabilization
- `Preconditioner` - None, Jacobi, or BlockJacobi preconditioning
- `CGSolverResult` - Solution with convergence statistics
- Presets: `high_accuracy()`, `realtime()`, `large_system()`
- Optimal for systems with 100+ constraints

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_constraint::{CGSolver, CGSolverConfig, Preconditioner};

let config = CGSolverConfig::realtime()
    .with_preconditioner(Preconditioner::Jacobi);
let mut solver = CGSolver::new(config);

let result = solver.solve(&joints, get_body_state, dt);
println!("Converged in {} iterations", result.iterations_used);
```

**Tendon Coupling Constraints (`sim-constraint/src/equality.rs`) — ⚠️ Standalone:**
- `TendonConstraint` - Joint-to-joint coupling via tendon mechanics
- Moment arm modeling for each connected joint
- Rest length and target length with slack/taut states
- Stiffness and damping for compliant constraints
- `TendonNetwork` - Collection of tendons for batch solving
- Presets: `two_joint()`, `finger()`

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_constraint::{TendonConstraint, TendonNetwork};
use sim_types::JointId;

let tendon = TendonConstraint::two_joint(
    "finger_flexor",
    JointId::new(0), 0.01,  // MCP joint, 1cm moment arm
    JointId::new(1), 0.008, // PIP joint, 0.8cm moment arm
    0.12,                    // 12cm rest length
);

let mut network = TendonNetwork::new();
network.add_tendon(tendon);
let forces = network.compute_all_forces(&get_position, &get_velocity, dt);
```

**Flex Edge Constraints (`sim-deformable/src/constraints.rs`) — ✅ Pipeline-integrated:**
- `FlexEdgeType` - Stretch, Shear, StretchShear, or Twist constraint types
- `FlexEdgeConstraint` - XPBD constraint for deformable edge behavior
- Stretch constraint for distance maintenance (2 vertices)
- Shear constraint for angular stiffness (3 vertices)
- Twist constraint for torsion resistance
- Damping support for energy dissipation
- Compatible with `XpbdSolver` for cloth and soft body simulation

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_deformable::{FlexEdgeConstraint, FlexEdgeType, XpbdSolver};

// Stretch constraint between two vertices
let stretch = FlexEdgeConstraint::stretch(0, 1, rest_length, compliance);

// Shear constraint for angular stiffness
let shear = FlexEdgeConstraint::shear([0, 1, 2], rest_angle, compliance);

// Combined stretch-shear
let combined = FlexEdgeConstraint::stretch_shear(
    [0, 1, 2], rest_length, rest_angle,
    stretch_compliance, shear_compliance,
);
```

**Height Field Collision (`sim-core/src/heightfield.rs`):**
- `HeightFieldData` - 2D grid of height values for terrain
- `HeightFieldContact` - Contact result with point, normal, penetration, cell
- Bilinear interpolation for smooth height sampling
- Normal computation via finite differences
- `CollisionShape::HeightField` - Integration with collision pipeline
- Collision detection with spheres, capsules, and boxes
- AABB computation for broad-phase integration
- Presets: `flat_terrain()`, `terrain_from_fn()`

**Usage:**
```rust
use sim_core::{CollisionShape, HeightFieldData};
use std::sync::Arc;

// Create height field from function
let terrain = CollisionShape::terrain_from_fn(100, 100, 1.0, |x, y| {
    (x * 0.1).sin() * (y * 0.1).cos() * 2.0  // Wavy terrain
});

// Or load from data
let heights: Vec<f64> = load_terrain_data();
let data = HeightFieldData::new(heights, 256, 256, 0.5);
let terrain = CollisionShape::heightfield(Arc::new(data));
```
