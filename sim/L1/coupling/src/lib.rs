//! Staggered forward soft↔rigid coupling — the Layer-2 keystone, forward half.
//!
//! Couples a [`sim_soft`] deformable body and a [`sim_core`] rigid body into one
//! simulation where they exchange contact force *both* ways, once per lockstep
//! step (a *partitioned* / staggered scheme). Each [`StaggeredCoupling::step`]:
//!
//! 1. reads the rigid body's pose (`sim_core::Data::xpos`) and poses the soft
//!    body's penalty-contact plane from it (rigid → soft);
//! 2. takes one *dynamic* backward-Euler soft step against that plane (the
//!    inertia term regularises the contact Newton solve — a quasi-static solve
//!    cannot make the no-contact→contact jump, see `docs/keystone/recon.md`);
//! 3. sums the contact `force_on_soft` over the active pairs;
//! 4. routes the Newton's-3rd-law reaction `−force_on_soft` onto the rigid
//!    body's `xfrc_applied` (soft → rigid);
//! 5. steps the rigid body.
//!
//! The two engines own their own solvers (the soft Newton-to-equilibrium step
//! and the rigid MuJoCo-aligned integrator); this crate only exchanges pose and
//! force at the interface. Validated by the forward gates in `tests/`: the
//! interface force balance holds and a rigid body settles when the soft
//! reaction matches its weight.
//!
//! Scope: penalty contact (a non-smooth stepping stone to IPC); a single
//! body-posed plane against a hand-built soft block; the soft solver is rebuilt
//! per step (re-posing in place is a deferred optimisation). Differentiability
//! was added incrementally and now spans both engines:
//! - the *explicit* (fixed-soft-position) coupled-step factors — the analytic
//!   contact-force-vs-pose derivative ([`StaggeredCoupling::contact_force_height_jacobian`])
//!   and the rigid force response ([`StaggeredCoupling::rigid_step_probe`]);
//! - the *implicit* soft re-equilibration term lifting them to the total
//!   single-step derivative ([`StaggeredCoupling::contact_force_height_total_jacobian`],
//!   via the soft solver's `equilibrium_pose_sensitivity`);
//! - the full **soft-tape `VjpOp` crossing** — ONE `tape.backward` across both
//!   engines ([`StaggeredCoupling::coupled_step_load_gradient`], chaining the
//!   soft Newton load adjoint with [`ContactForceVjp`] and [`RigidStepVjp`]);
//! - the soft **material-parameter** gradient
//!   ([`StaggeredCoupling::coupled_step_material_gradient`]) and its multi-step
//!   **time-adjoint** ([`StaggeredCoupling::coupled_trajectory_material_gradient`]),
//!   one `tape.backward` over an N-step coupled rollout — the gradient the
//!   co-design optimizer's *design* half consumes;
//! - the multi-step **open-loop control gradient**
//!   ([`StaggeredCoupling::coupled_trajectory_control_gradient`]) — `∂z_N/∂u_k`
//!   for a per-step platen control force (the control input adds to
//!   `xfrc_applied`, so it rides the same rigid carry as the contact reaction);
//! - the multi-step **closed-loop policy gradient**
//!   ([`StaggeredCoupling::coupled_trajectory_policy_gradient`]) — `∂z_N/∂θ` for a
//!   state-feedback policy `u_k = π_θ(state_k)` ([`DiffPolicy`]/[`LinearFeedback`]),
//!   backprop-through-time across the state→control recurrence on the same tape,
//!   the gradient the co-design optimizer's *policy* half consumes;
//! - the **joint design+policy gradient**
//!   ([`StaggeredCoupling::coupled_trajectory_joint_gradient`]) — BOTH the soft
//!   material design variable `μ` (λ = 4μ) AND the policy parameters `θ` live on
//!   ONE tape, read `(∂z_N/∂μ_total, ∂z_N/∂θ)` from one `tape.backward` — the
//!   mission's "one outer loop differentiating w.r.t. *both* design and policy".
