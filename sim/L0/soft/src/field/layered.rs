//! `LayeredScalarField` + `BlendedScalarField` — graded-material building
//! blocks per Part 7 §02 §01 [composition][c].
//!
//! [`LayeredScalarField`] is the discrete-step composition: an SDF drives
//! shell selection over a sorted threshold list, and each shell carries a
//! constant `f64` value. The 3-shell concentric-`SphereSdf` is the IV-4
//! validation scene per scope memo §1; the layered silicone device's
//! outer / middle / inner shells are the IV-5 end-to-end load case.
//!
//! [`BlendedScalarField`] is the smooth-step composition the book names
//! at §02 §01: a cubic Hermite smoothstep (`s²(3 − 2s)`, C¹ at the band
//! edges) blends two underlying [`Field<f64>`]s by an SDF-derived weight,
//! with the transition concentrated in a band `±band_half_width` around
//! the SDF zero set. Outside the band the blend snaps cleanly to the
//! dominant side's field with bit-exact 0/1 weights — the property the
//! book commits to in the "outside the band, the step resolves cleanly
//! to 0 or 1" sentence.
//!
//! Phase 4 ships `f64` only. `Vec3` (HGO fiber direction) and `Tensor3`
//! (full orthotropy) are Phase H per scope memo Decision A; the
//! existing [`Field<T>`](super::Field) trait surface is already generic
//! in `T`, so those land as additional concrete types here without a
//! trait change.
//!
//! Both types are deterministic functions of `x_ref` (Decision N
//! carry-forward of walking-skeleton invariant I-5): the threshold list
//! sorts once at construction and lives in a `Vec`; the blend kernel is
//! pure arithmetic on `phi`. No `HashMap` iteration, no float-equality
//! comparison on the sample hot path.
//!

/// `sample(x)`, `phi = sdf.eval(x)` is bucketed against `thresholds`
/// (binary search via [`slice::partition_point`]) and the corresponding
