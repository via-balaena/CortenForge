//! Parameter Jacobians of the simulation step (rigid *model* parameters).
//!
//! Where [`transition_derivatives`](crate::Data::transition_derivatives) gives
//! `A = ∂x⁺/∂x` (state) and `B = ∂x⁺/∂u` (control), this module provides the
//! third sibling: `∂x⁺/∂θ` for rigid **model** parameters `θ` — the gradient
//! channel that sim-to-real / system-ID calibration needs. The implemented
//! families are per-DOF **joint damping** (`mjd_damping_jacobian`), per-body
//! **mass** (`mjd_mass_jacobian`), per-body principal **inertia**
//! (`mjd_inertia_jacobian`), and per-DOF dry **friction**
//! (`mjd_friction_jacobian`). The three smooth channels (damping/mass/inertia) each
//! have a single-step Jacobian *and* a terminal-state trajectory Jacobian (the
//! latter sharing one parameter-agnostic forward-sensitivity recursion,
//! `param_trajectory_jacobian`).
//!
//! **Friction is single-step only.** It acts through the friction-loss *constraint*
//! rather than the smooth dynamics, so the per-step Jacobian is regime-dependent
//! (sliding vs sticking) and — crucially — stick↔slide transitions make a rollout
//! non-differentiable, which breaks the smooth `s_{t+1} = A_t·s_t + P_t` recursion
//! on any reversing trajectory. The trajectory layer for friction is therefore
//! finite-difference (in `cf-codesign`'s `FrictionSystemId`), not analytic. See
//! [`mjd_friction_jacobian`] for the full regime analysis.
//!
//! The math below derives the joint-damping channel; mass and inertia are
//! documented on their respective functions.
//!
//! # Math (single semi-implicit Euler step, eulerdamp)
//!
//! Joint damping `D` (a diagonal of per-DOF coefficients) enters the Euler step
//! through **two** paths — verified against the forward code, not assumed:
//!
//! - **Explicit** passive force: `qfrc_damper = −D·v` (`passive.rs`), which feeds
//!   the total force `rhs = qfrc_smooth + qfrc_constraint`.
//! - **Implicit** eulerdamp solve (`integrate`): `M_impl = M + h·D`, then
//!   `qacc_new = M_impl⁻¹·rhs` and `v⁺ = v + h·qacc_new`.
//!
//! Writing `rhs = G − D·v` with `G` damping-independent,
//! `v⁺ = v + h·M_impl⁻¹·(G − D·v)`. Differentiating w.r.t. the coefficient on
//! DOF `i` (which moves *both* the `M_impl` term and the `−D·v` term):
//!
//! ```text
//! ∂v⁺/∂D_i = −h · M_impl⁻¹ · E_ii · v⁺   ( = −h · v⁺_i · (M_impl⁻¹ column i) )
//! ```
//!
//! The two paths sum exactly: `−h²·qacc_new_i` (implicit) plus `−h·v_i`
//! (explicit) combine to `−h·v⁺_i` since `v⁺_i = v_i + h·qacc_new_i`. The driver
//! is the **post-step velocity `v⁺`**, not the eulerdamp acceleration `qacc` —
//! using `qacc` (the implicit path alone) is wrong by the explicit term.
//!
//! For semi-implicit Euler with hinge/slide joints the position is integrated as
//! `qpos⁺ = qpos + h·v⁺`, so the position-tangent row is simply `h · ∂v⁺/∂D`.
//!
//! With eulerdamp or dampers disabled the step solves with `M` alone
//! (`eulerdamp_applies`, as MuJoCo's `engine_forward.c:956`), and so does
//! every channel here; [`mjd_damping_jacobian`]'s Flags section gives the
//! damping channel then.

/// production `mj_crba` and `mj_rne` on a perturbation inertia distribution. The
/// inertia perturbation is cleaner than mass:
///
/// - The world-frame rotational inertia is `i_rot = R·diag(I_diag)·Rᵀ` with
///   `R = ximat[b]` (the body's principal-axis frame), **linear** in `I_diag`. So
///   `∂cinert[b]/∂I_diag[b][k]` is a 6×6 whose upper-left 3×3 is the rank-1 outer
///   product `r_k ⊗ r_k` (`r_k = ximat[b].column(k)`, the `k`-th principal axis in
///   world) and zero everywhere else — the mass-dependent parallel-axis, COM-
///   coupling, and translational blocks all have `∂/∂I = 0`. Zero for every body
///   other than `b`.
/// - **Gravity is inertia-independent** (the RNE gravity block reads only
///   `subtree_mass`/`subtree_com`), so the perturbation sets `subtree_mass = 0`
///   everywhere; only the Coriolis backward pass (which reads `cinert`)
///   contributes to `∂qfrc_bias/∂I`. (Contrast mass, which substitutes a unit
///   point-mass mass-moment for the gravity-torque derivative.)
///
/// The position-tangent row uses the hinge/slide semi-implicit map
/// `∂qpos⁺/∂I = h·∂v⁺/∂I`.
///
/// # Scope
///
/// Beyond the hard-asserted scope below, the operating point must be
/// **constraint-free** (no active contacts/joint limits), shared with the mass and
/// damping channels. The pure-rigid `n_link_pendulum` regime satisfies this.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// `O(nbody)` clones × 3 axes per call, each with an `mj_rne` + `mj_crba` pass —
/// `O(3·nbody)` re-evaluations, the same order as the mass channel times three.

/// # Panics

///   force* so it is well-defined even at `v_j = 0`). The position-tangent row is
///   `h · ∂v⁺/∂μ_j` (hinge/slide semi-implicit Euler). This needs **no**
///   differentiation of the nonlinear constraint solve — friction is a plain
///   explicit force in this regime.
/// - **Sticking** (the constraint holds *below* the cap, `|qfrc_constraint_j| <
///   μ_j`): the held force balances the smooth force independently of `μ_j`, so
///   `∂x⁺/∂μ_j = 0` exactly — and the joint is *locally unidentifiable* in `μ_j`
///   while it holds. The column is zero.
///
/// A spike confirmed both regimes against full finite differences (sliding to
/// `1.5e-6`, sticking to the exact zero).
///
/// # Why there is no analytic *trajectory* sibling
///
/// The smooth `s_{t+1} = A_t·s_t + P_t` recursion (used by the damping/mass/inertia
/// trajectory Jacobians) is machine-exact for friction **only on a strictly
/// sliding, no-velocity-reversal rollout**. Any stick↔slide transition or velocity
/// zero-crossing is a non-differentiable kink in the step, which corrupts the
/// carried sensitivity (a spike measured 15–66% error from a handful of crossing
/// steps). Friction system-ID over a real (reversing) trajectory therefore uses a
/// finite-difference trajectory gradient instead — robust to the kink, and cheap
/// because friction has few parameters. This single-step Jacobian is the honest
/// analytic per-step capability; the trajectory layer is FD by design.
///
/// # Scope
///
/// Model-level (hard-asserted): Euler integrator, hinge/slide joints, no tendons.
/// Operating-point (hard-asserted after constraint assembly): the friction-loss
/// constraints must be the *only* active constraints — no contacts, joint limits,
/// or equality constraints (this channel does not differentiate their forces).
