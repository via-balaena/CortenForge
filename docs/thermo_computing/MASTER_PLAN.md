# Thermodynamic Computing — Master Plan

> **Status**: Draft. Initial scaffold, populated from one round of recon (2026-04-09).
> **Branch**: `feature/thermo-computing`
> **Owner**: Jon

This is a *living* document. It captures the starting point, the estimated
endpoint, and the gap between them. As recon and implementation progress, both
ends move toward the middle. Every meaningful change should leave a dated entry
in the **Recon Log** at the bottom so the reasoning is preserved.

Child specs live next to this file in `docs/thermo_computing/`. They are
spawned from individual phases of **The Gap** as those phases mature from
"sketch" to "implementable."

## 5. Open Questions / Unknowns

These need answers before the relevant phase can start. Numbered for
referenceability.

- **Q1 — Noise vs. constraint projection.** When stochastic forces are
  written into `qfrc_applied` and projected by the constraint solver, what is
  the effective temperature on constrained DOFs? There is real literature on
  constrained Langevin dynamics (Lelièvre, Stoltz, *Free Energy Computations*)
  — needs a half-day read before Phase 2 can claim a meaningful equipartition
  test on articulated bodies.
- **Q2 — Implicit integrator interaction.** **RESOLVED 2026-04-09 (part 2).**
  Recon of `forward/mod.rs` and `integrate/mod.rs` showed that the canonical
  force-injection point is `qfrc_applied` between `step1()` and `step2()`,
  not a velocity update outside the integrator. Forces written there are
  folded into `qfrc_smooth` and projected by the constraint solver before
  `qacc` is computed; the `integrate()` step then propagates the noise through
  `qvel`. This is integrator-agnostic (Euler, ImplicitFast, Implicit all work;
  RK4 is excluded by the split-step API itself, which is fine for Langevin).
  No BAOAB or integrator bypass needed for Phase 1. See Recon Log entry
  2026-04-09 part 2 for the full trace.
- **Q3 — Does `thrml-rs` exist?** **RESOLVED 2026-04-09 (doc review S1)
  via web search.** Answer is *"yes, but with caveats."*
  - **Original THRML exists**: `extropic-ai/thrml` on GitHub — a JAX
    library, "Thermodynamic Hypergraphical Model Library," focused on
    block Gibbs sampling on sparse heterogeneous graphs and discrete
    EBMs. Confirms the original prompt's premise.
  - **Two community Rust ports exist**, both on GitHub, *neither
    apparently published to crates.io*:
    1. `SashimiSaketoro/thrml-rs` — described as a pure Rust
       implementation of GPU-accelerated sampling for PGMs, with a
       CPU/GPU/hybrid runtime abstraction (`GpuFast`, `CpuPrecise`,
       `Adaptive` routing modes).
    2. `Pingasmaster/thrml-rs` — "1:1 safe Rust rewrite of the JAX
       version. Compatibility is NOT guaranteed. Speed ~2x better on
       CPU, way worse on GPU."
  - **Neither port is officially maintained by Extropic.** Both are
    community ports of unknown maturity. Pingasmaster's explicit
    "compatibility not guaranteed" warning is a red flag for
    correctness-critical use.

  **Implication for Phase 6**: the original "bridge to THRML or
  implement native" framing remains correct, but the trade-off is
  richer than "exists / doesn't exist." Three options for Phase 6:
  - **(A) Depend on one of the community ports** — fastest path to a
    working bridge, but inherits unknown maintenance status and the
    "compatibility not guaranteed" risk. Pingasmaster's port is
    likely more stable based on the description; Sashimi's has the
    GPU story.
  - **(B) Implement a minimal native block-Gibbs sampler** in Rust
    (~few hundred LOC) — most consistent with the sharpen-the-axe
    discipline ("best plans, best materials"). No external dep risk,
    natively integrates with the `sim-thermostat` trait shape, full
    control. Slower to ship.
  - **(C) Vendor / fork one of the ports into a sibling crate**
    (`sim/L0/thrml/` → `sim-thrml`) — middle ground. Inherits the
    initial implementation, owns maintenance going forward, can
    adapt to the chassis (e.g., implement `PassiveComponent` /
    `Stochastic` directly).

  **No commitment yet**, but the leading direction is **(B)** —
  consistent with the same "narrow crates, full control, no external
  silent-failure dependencies" reasoning that drove items 4 and 8 of
  the recon round (`ChaCha8Rng` over `StdRng`, `sim-thermostat`
  sibling crate over sim-core integration). Phase 6 spec will decide.

  **What this changes about the build order**: nothing for Phases
  1-5. Q3 was a Phase 6 question and remains a Phase 6 question; the
  early resolution just sharpens the trade-off the Phase 6 spec will
  face. The "5-minute web search" was the right move because deferring
  it preserved an artificial "exists / doesn't exist" binary that
  hid the real "three options" structure.
- **Q4 — Default `dof_damping` is zero.** **RESOLVED 2026-04-09 (part 2) →
  option (a).** Thermostat carries its own `γ_thermostat[i]` parameter and
  writes both `−γ·qvel` *and* the FDT-paired noise into `qfrc_applied`. Reason:
  `model.implicit_damping` is the canonical per-DOF damping vector populated
  from `jnt_damping` at model init (`model_init.rs:911`) and consumed by
  Eulerdamp, the constraint solver, the implicit-fast `qacc` computation, and
  the derivatives engine. It is model-owned state. Mutating it per step would
  conflate physical damping (joint friction) with thermodynamic damping (FDT
  pairing). Thermostat-owned `γ` keeps the two cleanly separated.
- **Q5 — Is the cf-design → sim-core parameter pipeline already
  differentiable end-to-end?** Phases 5+ depend on it, *and* the
  D3 co-design experiment (the headline Research Direction) does
  too. **Status (updated 2026-04-09 by doc review M3)**: escalated
  from "deferred until Phase 5" to **active foreground recon,
  scheduled in parallel with the Phase 1 spec drafting**. Target
  resolution: before the Phase 1 spec is finalized, so the
  Phase 1+ build order is informed by the answer rather than
  committing to it blind.

  **Why escalated**: the asymmetric risk argument. If Q5 turns
  out "yes, cf-design is fully differentiable end-to-end," the
  cost of the early recon was a half-day and the build order
  is unchanged — no harm done. If Q5 turns out "no" (e.g.,
  non-differentiable booleans, FD-only past a certain layer,
  no autograd hookup at all), the build order *changes
  substantially*. Plausible reactions to a "no":
  1. Build the differentiable layer earlier — potentially
     before D1 (Brownian motor), reordering the priority ladder.
  2. Re-prioritize the Research Directions away from D3 toward
     D1+D2+D4, which need much less differentiability.
  3. Use a surrogate model (e.g., a small neural net trained
     on cf-design output) and explicitly accept the boundary.
  4. Implement the differentiable layer as a sim-thermostat-style
     sibling crate that wraps cf-design with custom autograd.

  Discovering this *after* months of Phases 1-4 commitment is
  the kind of avoidable surprise sharpen-the-axe forbids. The
  cost of doing the recon now is small; the cost of doing it
  late is potentially months.

  **Recon scope** (what to read, ~half-day):
  - `crates/cf-design/src/` — locate the autograd integration
    point (if any). Look for `Tensor`, `Variable`, `grad`,
    `backward`, or interop with `sim-ml-bridge`'s autograd
    engine.
  - The cf-design Phase 5 commit history (per project memory:
    "cf-design Phases 1–5 complete (including differentiable
    design optimization)") — read the spec for the
    differentiable design optimization phase.
  - SDF library composition: are booleans (union, difference,
    intersection) differentiable, or do they introduce
    non-differentiable kinks at the boundary?
  - Mesh extraction: marching cubes or a smooth alternative?
    Marching cubes is non-differentiable at the topology
    boundary.
  - Existing examples or tests that exercise the
    cf-design → sim-core parameter flow with gradients.

  **Recon log entry**: will be opened when the recon starts,
  named "2026-04-XX (part N) — Q5: cf-design end-to-end
  differentiability". This question is the next item on the
  recon queue after the Phase 1 spec is in flight.
- **Q6 — What's the right reward signal for Phase 7?** ESS, integrated
  autocorrelation time, KL divergence to target, wall-clock to convergence?
  Different choices give different agents. Defer the decision to Phase 6
  results.

## 6. Spec Index

Child specs spawned from phases of the Gap will be linked here as they are
written.

- [`THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md`](./THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md) — bolt-pattern
  design document for the `sim-thermostat` crate. Defines the
  `PassiveComponent` trait, the `PassiveStack` builder + composer, the
  clone-footgun resolution via `install_per_env`, the orthogonal
  `Diagnose` trait, the `test_utils` chassis (Welford's algorithm),
  and the on-disk crate layout. Six decisions (1-6), all RESOLVED.
  Read this *before* the Phase 1 spec — every Phase 1 implementation
  detail bolts into the chassis defined here.
- *(Phase 1 spec — `PHASE_1_LANGEVIN_THERMOSTAT_SPEC.md` — is the next
  artifact to produce, drafted in a fresh session against the chassis
  design above.)*

## 7. Recon Log

Dated entries documenting what we learned and how the plan changed. Append,
don't rewrite. This is the record of *why* the plan looks the way it does.

### 2026-04-09 — Initial scaffold

- **Trigger**: User shared a 5-layer thermodynamic computing proposal from a
  prior Claude session. Original proposal started at atomic-scale Langevin MD
  (`sim-langevin` as a new crate) and worked up through coarse-graining,
  rigid-body bridge, THRML, and RL.
- **Reframe**: After clarifying that the user's interest is *thermodynamic
  computing* specifically (not molecular dynamics), shifted the entire stack
  from atomic scale to **device scale**. Mechanical p-bits instead of
  transistors or atoms. This aligns with the existing CortenForge initiatives
  (cf-design, bio-inspired mechatronics, design → 3D print).
- **Recon findings**:
  - `qfrc_applied` and `xfrc_applied` already exist as MuJoCo-style applied
    force buffers, projected into `qfrc_smooth` before the constraint solve
    in `sim/L0/core/src/constraint/mod.rs` (lines 78–87).
  - Damping is already first-class across many domains: `dof_damping`,
    `jnt_damping`, `tendon_damping`, `flex_damping`, `flex_edgedamping`,
    `flex_bend_damping` (see `sim/L0/core/src/forward/passive.rs`).
  - This means **half of the FDT machinery already exists**. The only missing
    piece is the stochastic force term.
- **Decision**: Do *not* create a `sim-langevin` crate. Add a `Thermostat`
  abstraction as a small extension to sim-core's forward step instead. The
  proposal's "plug into sim-core integrator pattern" framing was wrong about
  the scale (should be at the forward-step level, not a parallel L0 crate).
- **Decision**: Phase 1 minimum viable test = 1-DOF damped harmonic
  oscillator equipartition. Smallest possible foothold; everything else gates
  on it.
- **Open questions raised**: Q1 (constraint projection), Q2 (implicit
  integrator interaction), Q3 (`thrml-rs` existence), Q4 (zero default
  damping), Q5 (cf-design differentiability), Q6 (reward signal choice).
- **Next action**: Read the forward step + integrator code carefully and
  draft the Phase 1 spec (`docs/thermo_computing/PHASE_1_LANGEVIN_THERMOSTAT_SPEC.md`).

### 2026-04-09 — Research Directions added

- **Trigger**: User asked whether the existing sim + RL stack could combine
  with the proposed thermo layer to do interesting research.
- **Result**: Section 2 (Research Directions) added, capturing five
  concrete experiments + one foundational connection. Sections 3–7
  renumbered accordingly.
- **Why these five**: Each is grounded in real published physics
  (Astumian/Magnasco for ratchets, Benzi/Wiesenfeld for SR, Pfeifer/Iida
  for morphological computation, Bennett/Landauer for reversible
  computation), each is achievable with the planned stack, and each is
  visually demonstrable. D3 (co-design) is the headline because it is the
  cleanest demonstration that all four CortenForge subsystems multiply.
- **Why the priority ladder**: Earliest payoff first (D1 — Brownian motor
  produces a stunning visual after only Phase 3). Headline experiment
  second (D3). Moat experiment (D4 — sim-to-real on a printed device) is
  highest stakes, longer horizon. Moonshot (D5) only after D1–D4 work.
- **Foundational connection flagged**: max-ent RL energy function +
  physical thermodynamic device energy function may be unifiable as a
  single shared `E(s,a)`. Needs a lit review before any novelty claim.
  Tracking item, not yet a phase.
- **No change to build order**: Phases 1–7 in The Gap are unchanged. The
  Research Directions inform *which experiments* to run within each phase,
  not the phase order itself.
- **Next action unchanged**: still draft the Phase 1 spec.

### 2026-04-09 (part 2) — Forward step + integrator code recon

- **Trigger**: Read `forward/mod.rs`, `integrate/mod.rs`, `integrate/euler.rs`,
  and traced `implicit_damping` usage across the crate to resolve Q2 and
  tighten Q4 before drafting the Phase 1 spec.
- **Pipeline structure**: `step()` → `forward()` → `integrate()`. The forward
  pipeline is split into `forward_pos_vel()` (FK, collision, velocity FK,
  energy, sensors) and `forward_acc()` (actuation, RNE, passive, constraint
  solve, qacc). `cb_control` fires at the boundary between them.
- **Documented force-injection API**: `step1()` runs `forward_pos_vel()` +
  `cb_control`; `step2()` runs `forward_acc()` + `integrate()`. The user is
  *expected* to write into `ctrl`, `qfrc_applied`, or `xfrc_applied` between
  step1 and step2. The doc comment on `step1` literally calls this out as
  the RL force-injection point. The thermostat is just another consumer of
  this hook. RK4 is excluded by design (multi-stage substeps recompute
  `forward()` internally) — fine, since Langevin + RK4 is mathematically
  problematic anyway.
- **Force flow trace**: `qfrc_applied[i] += …` → folded into `qfrc_smooth` in
  `constraint/mod.rs:78-87` (`qfrc_smooth = qfrc_applied + qfrc_actuator +
  qfrc_passive − qfrc_bias`, plus `xfrc_applied` projection) → constraint
  solver computes `qfrc_constraint` → `mj_fwd_acceleration` computes `qacc`
  with `M_hat = M − h·∂f/∂v` for implicit integrators → `integrate()` does
  `qvel += qacc * h` (or the Eulerdamp `(M + h·D)·qacc_new = rhs` solve when
  `implicit_damping > 0`). Position integration `qpos += qvel * h` then runs
  in `mj_integrate_pos` with proper SO(3) handling for ball/free joints, and
  `mj_normalize_quat` cleans up quaternion drift.
- **`implicit_damping` is model-owned state**: Populated from `jnt_damping`
  at model init (`model_init.rs:911`). Consumed by Eulerdamp
  (`integrate/mod.rs:85,94,136`), the constraint solver
  (`constraint/mod.rs:149,221`), implicit-fast acceleration
  (`forward/acceleration.rs:103`), and the derivatives engine
  (`derivatives/hybrid.rs:78`). Mutating it per step would couple thermostat
  damping to model damping in ways that break separation of concerns.
- **Free wake-up bonus**: `island/sleep.rs:132-150,522-539` already inspects
  both `qfrc_applied` and `xfrc_applied` for wake detection. **A sleeping
  body receiving thermal noise wakes up automatically.** No thermostat-
  specific logic needed for islanded simulations. Correctness win for free.
- **Q2 RESOLVED**: Use `qfrc_applied` injection between step1/step2. No
  BAOAB, no integrator bypass. Integrator-agnostic across Euler /
  ImplicitFast / Implicit.
- **Q4 RESOLVED (option a)**: Thermostat owns its own `γ_thermostat[i]` and
  writes both `−γ·qvel` and the FDT noise into `qfrc_applied`. Model damping
  stays untouched.
- **Phase 1 algorithm sharpened**: Explicit Langevin (Euler-Maruyama). For
  `M=1, k_spring=1, γ=0.1, k_B·T=1, h=0.001`: natural frequency `ω=1`,
  `h·ω=0.001`, damping ratio `ζ=γ/(2√(kM))=0.05` (underdamped, healthy
  mixing), discretization temperature error `O(h·γ/M) ≈ 10⁻⁴` — well below
  the `~10⁻²` sampling-error tolerance for 10⁵ samples. Equipartition test
  should pass with margin.
- **Did NOT resolve**: Q1 (constraint projection — irrelevant for 1-DOF
  Phase 1, gates Phase 2), Q3 (`thrml-rs` existence — gates Phase 6),
  Q5 (cf-design end-to-end differentiability — gates Phase 5), Q6 (Phase 7
  reward signal — defer until Phase 6 results inform the choice).
- **Phase-1-blocking recon items still open** (small, listed in the post-
  recon report): PRNG conventions, `qfrc_applied` lifecycle / auto-clearing,
  existing usage patterns for writing into `qfrc_applied`, `model.timestep`
  variability, statistical-test infrastructure conventions, where the
  thermostat module should live in the crate, public mutability of
  `Data::qfrc_applied`.
- **Next action**: Answer the Phase-1-blocking recon items (small focused
  recon round), *then* draft the Phase 1 spec.

### 2026-04-09 (part 3) — Phase-1-blocking item 2: `qfrc_applied` lifecycle

- **Trigger**: First item in the Phase-1-blocking recon round, taken under
  the sharpen-the-axe discipline (one item at a time, fully logged before
  moving on). Picked first because it is the most correctness-critical of
  the open items and it shapes the thermostat API.
- **Question**: Does the forward pipeline auto-clear `qfrc_applied` at the
  start of each step, or does the user own clearing? Answer determines
  whether the thermostat does `=` (overwrite) or `+=` (accumulate), and
  shapes the API for composing the thermostat with future writers.
- **Finding**: `qfrc_applied` is **user-owned and persistent across steps**.
  The forward pipeline never clears it. It is only zeroed in two places,
  both reset functions:
  - `Data::reset()` at `data.rs:1123` (full reset, in the "force vectors —
    zero" block)
  - `Data::reset_to_keyframe()` at `data.rs:1245` (keyframe reset, with
    explicit doc-comment: *"Clears derived quantities (...) and user-applied
    forces (qfrc_applied, xfrc_applied) — matching the convention of
    Data::reset()"*)

  Initialization at `model_init.rs:540` is `DVector::zeros(self.nv)`. No
  per-step clear anywhere in `forward/`, `integrate/`, or `step()`.
- **Convention is documented loudly** in the batch-sim API
  (`batch.rs:106-110`): *"Use this to set ctrl, qfrc_applied, xfrc_applied,
  or any other input field before calling step_all()."* And
  `batch.rs:171-175`: *"[reset_one] does **not** zero qfrc_applied /
  xfrc_applied (see Data::reset documentation). Callers must zero these
  explicitly if needed."* `inverse.rs:23-25` confirms the categorization:
  `qfrc_applied + qfrc_actuator + J^T*xfrc_applied = "the total
  user-supplied generalized forces"`. This matches MuJoCo's convention
  exactly: external forces persist to model constant external loads; user
  owns the lifecycle.
- **Implication**: Thermal noise is i.i.d. per step. Accumulating across
  steps without clearing is wrong physics — `qfrc_applied` would random-walk
  and the equilibrium temperature would drift upward over time (variance
  compounding). The thermostat must either overwrite, clear-then-accumulate,
  be the only writer, or use a separate field.
- **Two schemes compared** (per sharpen-the-axe rule "Two schemes, then
  choose"):
  - **Option A — Sole-writer overwrite**: Thermostat does
    `data.qfrc_applied[i] = -γ·qvel + noise`. Documented contract:
    *"LangevinThermostat is the sole writer of qfrc_applied while active.
    For additional forces, use xfrc_applied or ctrl."*
    - **Pros**: Foolproof — no silent compounding possible by construction.
      A-grade enforceable (debug-assert invariant in tests). Zero cost for
      Phase 1 validation (no other forces in the test). Failure mode (a
      user trying to compose) is **loud and immediate** — they see their
      force vanish.
    - **Cons**: Doesn't compose with controllers / RL policies that also
      want to write `qfrc_applied`. Future RL/controller users must use
      `xfrc_applied` or `ctrl` instead, or wait for an upstream redesign.
  - **Option B — Additive, caller clears**: Thermostat does `+=`. Caller
    must `data.qfrc_applied.fill(0.0)` each step before calling `apply()`.
    - **Pros**: Composable with other writers. Matches MuJoCo's "user owns
      lifecycle" convention exactly.
    - **Cons**: **Silent correctness failure** if caller forgets to clear.
      Early steps would still pass equipartition (per-step variance is
      right), but temperature would drift upward as the random walk in
      `qfrc_applied` accumulates. Failure mode is invisible, delayed, and
      exactly the hardest kind of bug to debug.
- **Decision: Option A for Phase 1.** Reasoning:
  1. Option B's failure mode (silent, delayed, wrong physics that passes
     early validation) is precisely what sharpen-the-axe is meant to
     prevent. Option A makes that failure mode impossible by construction.
  2. Phase 1 has zero composability requirement — the 1-DOF damped harmonic
     oscillator validation has no other forces. Designing the more flexible
     API for a feature we don't yet need is premature optimization, *and
     the flexibility is itself the source of the bug*.
  3. Composability is a Phase 4-7 concern; we'll know what the right
     interface looks like by then. Designing it now based on guesses is
     speculative scaffolding.
  4. Migration A → C (see below) is a focused localized change. Migration
     B → A would be a breaking change after users have written code against
     additive semantics — much more painful.
  5. Option A's downside is loud and immediate; Option B's is silent and
     delayed. Loud failures are cheap, silent failures are expensive.
- **Forward-looking — Option C, NOT for Phase 1**: The eventual right
  answer for Phase 4+ composability is probably a dedicated
  `qfrc_thermostat: DVector<f64>` field on `Data`, summed alongside
  `qfrc_applied` in the canonical aggregation in `constraint/mod.rs:78-87`.
  This preserves `qfrc_applied` for user/RL writes while giving the
  thermostat its own clean slate. Invasive (modifies the canonical
  force-sum, requires upstream sim-core support, touches the constraint
  module). Explicitly out of scope for Phase 1. Flag in the Phase 1 spec
  as the eventual end-state; revisit when Phase 4 (coupled bistable
  arrays) starts running into composition needs.
- **Item 2 RESOLVED**: Phase 1 thermostat uses sole-writer overwrite
  semantics. Documented contract, debug-assert invariant in tests, Option
  C flagged as future work.
- **What item 2 leaves open for item 3**: Whether a `cb_passive` (or
  similar passive-force) callback hook exists. If it does, the thermostat
  might more idiomatically write into `qfrc_passive` instead, sharing the
  existing damping/spring infrastructure — which would change the Option
  A/C tradeoff entirely. This question naturally belongs to item 3
  (existing usage patterns for writing applied forces). If found, revisit
  item 2's decision before drafting the Phase 1 spec.
- **Next action**: Phase-1-blocking recon item 3 — existing usage patterns
  for writing into `qfrc_applied`, including the `cb_passive` hook
  question.

### 2026-04-09 (part 4) — Item 3 first finding: `cb_passive` exists, item 2 REVISED

- **Trigger**: Started item 3 (existing usage patterns for writing into
  `qfrc_applied`) under sharpen-the-axe. The very first searches for
  `cb_passive` returned hits, exposing a documented hook that materially
  changes item 2's decision. Stopped item 3 immediately to surface the
  finding, per the "stop and ask when uncertain" principle.
- **What `cb_passive` is** — a documented user passive-force callback hook
  on `Model`, analogous to `cb_control`. Citations:
  - `model.rs:1002` — `pub cb_passive: Option<super::callbacks::CbPassive>`
  - `model.rs:1242, 1247` — setter and clearer methods
  - `model_init.rs:396` — initialized to `None` (opt-in by default)
  - `callbacks.rs:37-41` — type definition + contract
  - `forward/passive.rs:719` — invocation site

  Type: `Callback<dyn Fn(&Model, &mut Data) + Send + Sync>` — `Fn` (not
  `FnMut`), thread-safe, `Send + Sync` for cross-thread sharing in
  BatchSim.

  Documented contract (`callbacks.rs:37-41`): *"Passive force callback:
  called at end of `mj_fwd_passive()`. Use to inject custom passive forces
  (e.g., viscous drag, spring models). The callback may modify
  `data.qfrc_passive` or any other Data field."*
- **What `qfrc_passive` is** — engine-owned, **auto-cleared every step**.
  In `forward/passive.rs`:
  - Line 368 — `mj_fwd_passive()` *starts* by zeroing `qfrc_passive`,
    `qfrc_spring`, `qfrc_damper`, `qfrc_fluid`, `qfrc_gravcomp`
    (sleep-aware: only awake DOFs cleared if sleeping).
  - Lines 388–665 — spring, damper, tendon, flex, bending, fluid, and
    gravcomp forces accumulate into per-component arrays.
  - Line 681 — aggregation: `qfrc_passive = qfrc_spring + qfrc_damper`
    (assignment, not accumulation).
  - Lines 683–706 — gravcomp and fluid added optionally.
  - Line 719 — `cb_passive` fires *after* aggregation; the callback sees
    the populated `qfrc_passive` and can `+=` into it freely.
  - Lines 723–731 — plugin passive forces fire *after* `cb_passive`.

  `qfrc_passive` then flows into `qfrc_smooth` via
  `constraint/mod.rs:78-87` — same path as `qfrc_applied`, same projection
  by the constraint solver, same wake-up support.
- **Why this changes item 2**: Item 2's Option A (sole-writer overwrite of
  `qfrc_applied`) was forced by the fact that `qfrc_applied` is user-owned
  and persistent across steps — any additive scheme could silently compound
  noise. `qfrc_passive` is the opposite: engine-owned, auto-cleared. The
  thermostat can `+=` into it with zero risk of compounding because the
  next step starts from zero by construction. **The Option A vs B
  trade-off dissolves entirely.**
- **And the ontology is correct**: Langevin damping + FDT-paired stochastic
  forcing is *literally a passive thermal force*. The right sim-core
  categorization is:
  - `qfrc_actuator` — controlled actuator forces (motors, muscles)
  - `qfrc_passive` — passive forces (springs, damping, fluid drag,
    **thermal bath**)
  - `qfrc_applied` — external user-applied forces (RL action injection,
    manual loads)
  - `qfrc_constraint` — constraint reaction forces

  The thermostat belongs in `qfrc_passive`. Item 2 was solving the right
  problem in the wrong category.
- **Trade-off comparison** (cb_passive vs item 2 Option A):

  | Concern | Option A (qfrc_applied overwrite) | cb_passive + qfrc_passive |
  |---|---|---|
  | Compounding-safe? | Yes (overwrite) | Yes (auto-cleared) |
  | Composes with RL writers of `qfrc_applied`? | No | Yes (different field) |
  | Composes with multiple thermostats / passive plugins? | N/A | Yes |
  | Requires split-step API? | Yes (manual hook) | No (`step()` works) |
  | Idiomatic? | Hijacks user-input field | Uses the documented hook for exactly this purpose |
  | Forward-looking Option C still needed? | Yes, eventually | No — composability achieved already |

  cb_passive dominates on every axis except one — the RNG constraint —
  which is solvable.
- **The RNG constraint and its solution**: `cb_passive` is `Fn`, not
  `FnMut`. The closure cannot capture mutable state directly. Solution:
  the `LangevinThermostat` struct owns its state behind interior
  mutability, the closure captures `Arc<LangevinThermostat>`:

  ```rust
  pub struct LangevinThermostat {
      gamma: DVector<f64>,
      k_b_t: f64,
      rng: Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>,  // PRNG choice = recon item 4
  }

  impl LangevinThermostat {
      pub fn install(self: Arc<Self>, model: &mut Model) {
          let me = Arc::clone(&self);
          model.set_passive_callback(move |m, d| me.apply(m, d));
      }

      fn apply(&self, model: &Model, data: &mut Data) {
          let h = model.timestep;
          let mut rng = self.rng.lock().unwrap();
          for i in 0..self.gamma.len() {
              let g = self.gamma[i];
              let damping = -g * data.qvel[i];
              let noise = (2.0 * g * self.k_b_t / h).sqrt()
                  * standard_normal(&mut *rng);
              data.qfrc_passive[i] += damping + noise;
          }
      }
  }
  ```

  Properties: thread-safe (matches `Send + Sync` bound), reproducible
  (RNG is per-instance, seedable), local (no `Data` mutation needed).
  PRNG choice is recon item 4 — placeholder.
- **Caveats for the spec** (NOT Phase 1 blockers; flagged for later):
  1. **Derivatives / FD perturbation** — `cb_passive` *will* fire inside
     `forward_skip()` because `mj_fwd_passive` is called from
     `forward_acc`, which `forward_skip` calls. For deterministic
     derivative computation in Phase 5, the thermostat needs gating or
     RNG snapshot/restore. Phase 1 doesn't compute derivatives.
  2. **Plugin passive forces fire after `cb_passive`** — not a Phase 1
     issue (no plugins), but worth flagging in the spec.
  3. **Mutex lock contention** — one lock per step is negligible for
     single-env sims. For BatchSim parallel envs, each env needs its
     OWN thermostat instance with its own RNG, not a single shared
     thermostat. The API should make the wrong choice hard.
- **DECISION REVISED**: Item 2's Option A is **superseded**. The Phase 1
  thermostat lives in `cb_passive` and writes into `qfrc_passive` with
  accumulation semantics. The forward-looking Option C (dedicated
  `qfrc_thermostat` field) is no longer needed — `cb_passive` already
  achieves the composability goal. Item 2's log entry remains for
  historical reasoning; the decision-trail is the value, not just the
  current decision.
- **Phase 1 section in The Gap UPDATED in this same commit** to reflect
  the new algorithm. The old text described the `qfrc_applied` approach
  and is no longer accurate. Reading the master plan top-to-bottom now
  yields a consistent design.
- **Item 3 status**: First finding extracted (cb_passive exists — the
  most consequential bit). Item 3 is **otherwise still open**: we still
  need to read existing patterns for writing into `qfrc_applied`
  (`ml-bridge/src/space.rs`, `tests/integration/split_step.rs`,
  `examples/coupled_pendulums.rs`) to understand how RL controllers
  inject forces, even though the thermostat doesn't go through that
  path — the knowledge is relevant for Phase 7 composition. That recon
  happens in a fresh session.
- **Next action (fresh session)**: Continue item 3 — existing
  `qfrc_applied` usage patterns in `ml-bridge/src/space.rs`,
  `tests/integration/split_step.rs`, and `examples/coupled_pendulums.rs`.
  Then proceed to items 4–7 (PRNG conventions, `Data` field public
  mutability, `model.timestep` variability, statistical-test
  conventions, thermostat module location). After all Phase-1-blocking
  items are answered, draft `PHASE_1_LANGEVIN_THERMOSTAT_SPEC.md`.

### 2026-04-09 (part 5) — Item 3 closed: existing `qfrc_applied` write patterns

- **Trigger**: Continuation of recon item 3, the *rest* of it. Part 4
  closed the `cb_passive` sub-question and revised the Phase 1 design;
  this entry closes the remainder by reading the three files cataloging
  how RL controllers and example code currently inject forces:
  `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/space.rs`, `sim/L0/tests/integration/split_step.rs`,
  `sim/L1/bevy/examples/coupled_pendulums.rs`. The thermostat itself
  doesn't go through `qfrc_applied` anymore, so this is forward-looking
  recon for Phase 7 composition with RL — *not* Phase 1 design input.
- **Pattern 1 — ml-bridge `ActionSpace::apply`**
  (`ml-bridge/src/space.rs:599-768`, call site `env.rs:133-146`):
  - **Cadence**: action injection happens *before* `data.step()`, with
    plain `step()`. Not split-step. The `SimEnv::step()` body is literally
    `act_space.apply(action, &mut self.data, &self.model); for _ in 0..sub_steps { self.data.step(...)?; … }`.
  - **Semantics**: pure overwrite. `Injector::QfrcApplied` does
    `data.qfrc_applied[i] = f64::from(val)` (line 644). Same shape for
    `XfrcApplied` (line 651), `Ctrl` (line 639, with clamp), `MocapPos`,
    `MocapQuat`. There is no `+=` anywhere in the injector path.
  - **Range coverage**: each injector overwrites only the indices in its
    declared `Range<usize>`. **Indices outside the declared range are not
    cleared.** Safe today because `Data::reset()` zeros `qfrc_applied` and
    `SimEnv::reset()` calls `Data::reset()`, but the injector contract is
    "I own my range," not "I own the field."
  - **Five disjoint slots**: ctrl, qfrc_applied, xfrc_applied, mocap_pos,
    mocap_quat. ml-bridge composes multiple injectors *only* via field
    disjointness — never two writers to the same slot.
- **Pattern 2 — `split_step.rs` integration test**
  (`sim/L0/tests/integration/split_step.rs:87-121`):
  - The *only* in-tree consumer of the documented split-step force-injection
    cadence. Writes `data.qfrc_applied[0] = 5.0` between `step1()` and
    `step2()` and asserts the trajectory diverges from a baseline.
  - It is a **contract test** for the split-step API, not a usage
    cookbook. It does not represent the dominant idiom in the codebase.
- **Pattern 3 — `coupled_pendulums.rs` Bevy example**
  (`sim/L1/bevy/examples/coupled_pendulums.rs:359-394`):
  - **Cadence**: identical to ml-bridge — write before plain `step()`,
    no split-step. Inside the substep loop:
    `data.qfrc_applied[0] = coupling; data.qfrc_applied[1] = -coupling;
    data.step(&model)?;`
  - **Semantics**: overwrite with state-dependent value
    (`coupling = -KAPPA * (theta1 - theta2)`).
  - **Reset path is manual**: the restart handler does
    `qpos.fill(0.0); qvel.fill(0.0); qfrc_applied.fill(0.0); time = 0.0`
    explicitly, *bypassing* `Data::reset()`. The author *knows*
    `qfrc_applied` is persistent across steps and clears it explicitly.
    Confirms the cultural awareness of MuJoCo "user owns lifecycle."
- **Synthesis — three observations that matter for the thermostat:**
  1. **Both real-world writers (ml-bridge and coupled_pendulums) use
     plain `step()`, not split-step.** The `step1`/`step2` API is
     documented + tested but the codebase's actual writers don't reach
     for it; they write to `qfrc_applied` *before* `step()` and rely on
     overwrite the next iteration. **This validates the cb_passive
     design choice from part 4** — the thermostat will use plain
     `step()` too, joining the dominant convention. The split-step API
     remains a tool in the toolbox but is not the idiom.
  2. **Both real-world writers use `=`, not `+=`.** Each owns the index
     it cares about and overwrites it each step. Multiple writers to the
     *same* index would clobber each other; the codebase has no
     established protocol for that case because it has never needed one.
     **Field disjointness is the de facto composition idiom.**
  3. **The thermostat (`qfrc_passive`) and ml-bridge `ActionSpace`
     (`qfrc_applied`/`xfrc_applied`/`ctrl`) live in different fields.
     They cannot clobber each other.** Composition with RL is automatic
     and trivial — no API design needed in Phase 1, and Phase 7 inherits
     it for free. Document this in the Phase 1 spec under "Composition
     with other writers" so future readers understand it was *designed
     in*, not stumbled into.
- **Two surprises (neither blocks Phase 1, both flagged for the user):**
  1. **Doc/code drift on `step1()`'s doc-comment**. Part 2's recon noted
     that the `step1()` doc-comment "literally calls out [the
     step1/step2 hook] as the RL force-injection point." That doc is
     accurate as a *capability* statement but does not match the *actual
     ml-bridge code path*, which writes before plain `step()`. Not a
     bug, not a design issue, but the doc reads as if split-step is the
     RL idiom when in fact it isn't. Worth a doc fixup eventually; out
     of scope for this branch.
  2. **The thermostat will be the workspace's first `cb_passive`
     consumer.** `callbacks.rs:37-41` documents the API; nothing in
     `sim/`, `examples/`, or any test currently uses it. (Verified by
     the absence of any hits in the three target files and by the fact
     that Phase 1 design searches in part 4 found only the type
     definition + initialization sites, not call sites.) **Implication
     for the spec**: tests need to establish the precedent for
     callback-RNG reproducibility patterns. A small dedicated test —
     "the callback fires once per `step()`, RNG advances by exactly the
     expected count" — should be in the Phase 1 validation suite, not
     just the equipartition test.
- **Latent footgun noted (NOT Phase 1 relevant)**: The
  `Injector::QfrcApplied` contract is "I overwrite my range, I do not
  clear unrelated indices." Safe today via `Data::reset()`. If a user
  ever combines an `ActionSpace` with the escape-hatch `data_mut()` and
  bypasses reset, stale `qfrc_applied` values outside the action range
  would persist across episodes. Not introduced by anything thermostat-
  related; flagging for ml-bridge maintainers as a docs improvement
  opportunity. Out of scope for this branch.
- **Implications for the Phase 1 spec** (concrete, will appear in the
  spec when it gets drafted):
  - **Composition section**: state explicitly that the thermostat lives
    in `qfrc_passive` via `cb_passive`, that ml-bridge writers live in
    `qfrc_applied`/`xfrc_applied`/`ctrl`, and that field disjointness
    makes composition automatic. Cite the three patterns in this entry.
  - **Test section**: include a callback-firing-count test in addition
    to the equipartition test. Establishes the `cb_passive` test
    precedent for the workspace.
  - **Cadence section**: the canonical user pattern is plain `step()`.
    No split-step required. State this explicitly so a beginner reading
    the spec doesn't reach for `step1()`/`step2()` thinking it's
    necessary.
- **Item 3 RESOLVED.** Both halves are now closed: the `cb_passive`
  sub-question (part 4, design-changing) and the existing-pattern survey
  (this entry, design-confirming). No revisions to the Phase 1 design
  result from this entry — only documentation hooks for the spec.
- **Next action**: Phase-1-blocking recon item 4 — PRNG conventions in
  CortenForge. Question: which PRNG crate is the workspace standard
  (`rand` + `rand_chacha`? something else? a custom in-tree generator?),
  what seeding patterns are already used in tests/examples, and is
  there a documented thread-safe-RNG idiom. Answer determines the
  concrete type behind `Mutex<PRNG>` in the `LangevinThermostat` struct.

### 2026-04-09 (part 6) — Item 4: PRNG conventions

- **Trigger**: Recon item 4 under sharpen-the-axe. The placeholder
  `Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>` in part 4's API sketch needs to either match an
  existing convention or be deliberately chosen against one. Until that
  is settled, the Phase 1 spec cannot name a concrete RNG type.
- **Workspace declarations** (root `Cargo.toml:375-376`):
  ```toml
  rand = "0.9"
  rand_distr = "0.5"
  ```
  Plus `STANDARDS.md:316`: *"No duplicate functionality (e.g., both
  `rand` and `fastrand`)"*. The `rand` family is the canonical and only
  blessed RNG ecosystem in the workspace. `fastrand` appears only as a
  transitive dep of build tools (tempfile, etc.), never as a workspace
  dep. No custom in-tree PRNG.
- **Existing seeding pattern — single, uniform**: every seeded RNG in
  the codebase uses `rand::rngs::StdRng` with `seed_from_u64`. Hits:
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/cem.rs:14,139` — `StdRng::seed_from_u64(seed)`
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/sac.rs:20,262` — same
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/ppo.rs:16,219` — same
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/td3.rs:17,235` — same
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/reinforce.rs:17,163` — same
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/replay_buffer.rs:183,236` — same
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/autograd_policy.rs:1017,1038` — same
  - `sim/L0/ml-bridge/tests/competition.rs` — 9 seeded sites, all same
  - Bench files (`sim/L0/simd/benches/...`, `sim/L0/core/benches/...`)
    use `rand::rng()` (unseeded thread-local) — appropriate for
    benches, irrelevant to validation.
  - **Zero hits for `ChaCha8Rng`, `SmallRng`, `Pcg`, `Xoshiro`,** or
    any explicitly-named PRNG algorithm anywhere in `sim/`. The
    workspace is 100% `StdRng`.
- **The `StdRng` reproducibility hazard — already known to maintainers**.
  `sim/L0/ml-bridge/DEFERRED.md:47-53` explicitly flags this:

  > **Pin RNG algorithm** — Replace `StdRng` with an explicit algorithm
  > (e.g., `ChaCha8Rng`) across all algorithms and builders. `StdRng`
  > is documented as not reproducible across `rand` versions.
  > `Cargo.lock` pins it in practice, but an explicit algorithm guards
  > against silent result changes on dependency bumps. Mechanical
  > find-and-replace.

  In other words: ml-bridge already concluded that `StdRng` is wrong,
  proposed `ChaCha8Rng` as the replacement, and parked the migration as
  deferred work. The thermostat lands into a codebase that has the
  *intention* but not yet the *implementation* of the right convention.
- **`rand_chacha` is already a transitive dep**: `Cargo.lock` shows
  `rand_chacha 0.9.0` (and an old `0.3.1` from a build tool). It is
  pulled in transitively by `rand 0.9` itself. **Adding it as a
  top-level workspace dep is a no-cost organizational change**, not a
  new compile-time dep.
- **`rand_distr` is declared but unused** in production code. The only
  hit in `sim/` is a *negative* citation in
  `sim/L0/ml-bridge/POLICY_PERSISTENCE_SPEC.md:1237`:
  *"No `rand`/`rand_distr` dependency — CEM handles its own RNG
  internally..."*. The workspace declares `rand_distr = "0.5"` but no
  crate currently consumes it. **The thermostat will be the workspace's
  first `rand_distr` consumer** (for `StandardNormal`).
- **Thread-safe RNG idiom — none documented, none needed yet**. Every
  existing RNG owner in the codebase passes `&mut rng` through internal
  call chains within a single thread. ml-bridge gives each algorithm
  its own owned `StdRng`; replay buffers, policies, and tests all hold
  exclusive `&mut` references. There is no `Mutex<Rng>` anywhere in the
  workspace. The thermostat's `Mutex<PRNG>` (forced by `cb_passive`
  being `Fn` not `FnMut`) is **a new pattern for the codebase**.
- **`sim-core`'s rand dependency surface — important structural finding**:
  - `sim-core/Cargo.toml:24` has `rand = { workspace = true }` *only in
    `[dev-dependencies]`*. Production sim-core does **not** depend on
    `rand` at all.
  - `sim-core` does not depend on `rand_chacha` (transitively or
    directly).
  - `sim-core` does not depend on `rand_distr`.

  **If the thermostat lives inside sim-core**, all three will become
  production dependencies of sim-core. This is a non-trivial change to
  sim-core's surface area: a 100% deterministic physics core gains a
  stochastic RNG dep tree. Not a blocker — `rand` is a high-quality
  small dep — but it interacts with item 8 (thermostat module
  location). If item 8 ends up with the thermostat in a sibling L0
  crate (e.g., `sim-thermostat`), sim-core's deps stay clean and the
  RNG deps live where they are used. **This is the most consequential
  finding from item 4** and the user should make the call deliberately
  rather than have it follow from a default choice on item 8.

- **Two schemes compared** (per "Two schemes, then choose"):
  - **Scheme A — Inherit `StdRng`**. Use `rand::rngs::StdRng` with
    `seed_from_u64`, matching every other seeded RNG in the workspace.
    - **Pros**: Zero new deps. Consistent with the existing codebase
      pattern. Drop-in find/replace migration when ml-bridge eventually
      does its DEFERRED.md cleanup.
    - **Cons**: `StdRng` is documented as **not reproducible across
      `rand` versions**. The Phase 1 equipartition test is a
      *numerical validation gate* — the temperature must hit
      `½ k_B·T` to within `~10⁻²`. If a future `rand` bump silently
      changes `StdRng`'s underlying algorithm, the equipartition test
      result will shift. The shift may be small enough that the test
      still passes, but the *meaning* of "passing" will have changed
      between dependency bumps. Failure mode is **silent and delayed**
      — exactly the class sharpen-the-axe is meant to prevent (cf.
      part 3's reasoning against Option B for item 2).
  - **Scheme B — Use `ChaCha8Rng` directly**. Use
    `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng` with `seed_from_u64`. Add
    `rand_chacha = "0.9"` to workspace deps (organizational only —
    already in `Cargo.lock`).
    - **Pros**: Explicit algorithm = bit-stable across `rand` /
      `rand_chacha` versions = reproducibility guaranteed. Aligns with
      the documented future direction in `ml-bridge/DEFERRED.md`. The
      thermostat sets a clean precedent that the eventual ml-bridge
      migration follows rather than maintaining two patterns. ChaCha8
      is non-cryptographic-strength but has excellent statistical
      properties — overkill is fine, the cost is one extra ALU
      operation per draw which is negligible compared to a full
      `step()` of physics.
    - **Cons**: Adds `rand_chacha` to top-level workspace deps (no new
      compile dep, only a declaration). Thermostat is the first
      explicit consumer in the workspace — sets a precedent that ml-
      bridge has not yet adopted, which produces a brief two-pattern
      window until DEFERRED.md is done.
- **Recommendation: Scheme B (`ChaCha8Rng`)**. Reasoning:
  1. Reproducibility is non-negotiable for the Phase 1 validation
     gate. The equipartition test is the *foundation* the rest of the
     thermo line builds on; a silent reproducibility hazard at the
     foundation is exactly the failure mode sharpen-the-axe forbids.
  2. ml-bridge maintainers have already concluded `ChaCha8Rng` is the
     right answer; choosing it for the thermostat does not introduce a
     novel decision, only completes one already made.
  3. `rand_chacha` is already in `Cargo.lock` as a transitive dep, so
     the marginal compile cost is zero. The "new dep" is purely
     organizational.
  4. The "first explicit consumer" framing is actually a positive: the
     thermostat lands clean and the eventual ml-bridge migration has
     one pattern to copy, not two patterns to reconcile.
  5. ChaCha8 (8 rounds) is the right cipher choice for non-cryptographic
     statistical use — `ChaCha20Rng` is overkill, `ChaCha12Rng` adds
     half the cost for no statistical gain at this scale, and the
     DEFERRED.md note already names ChaCha8 as the target.
- **`rand_distr` choice (sub-decision)**: The thermostat needs Gaussian
  samples for the noise term. Two ways to get them in `rand_distr 0.5`:
  - `rand_distr::StandardNormal` — zero-parameter unit-variance normal,
    `(2γkT/h)^{1/2}` is applied as a multiplicative scale outside the
    sample. Cleaner: the thermostat owns the scale, the distribution
    just produces standard normals.
  - `rand_distr::Normal::new(0.0, sigma).unwrap()` — a parameterized
    distribution. Slightly more allocation per call (the distribution
    object) but lets `rand_distr` compute the scaled sample directly.

  **Choice**: `StandardNormal`. The scale `(2γkT/h)^{1/2}` is
  per-DOF (γ is per-DOF) and is recomputed per step (h depends on
  `model.timestep`, which is item 6's open question — could vary). A
  single `StandardNormal` distribution + per-DOF/per-step scale is the
  cleanest factoring. Document in the spec.
- **Concrete API update** for the part 4 sketch:
  ```rust
  use rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng;
  use rand::SeedableRng;
  use rand_distr::{StandardNormal, Distribution};

  pub struct LangevinThermostat {
      gamma: DVector<f64>,
      k_b_t: f64,
      rng: Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>,
  }

  impl LangevinThermostat {
      pub fn new(gamma: DVector<f64>, k_b_t: f64, seed: u64) -> Self {
          Self {
              gamma,
              k_b_t,
              rng: Mutex::new(ChaCha8Rng::seed_from_u64(seed)),
          }
      }

      fn apply(&self, model: &Model, data: &mut Data) {
          let h = model.timestep;
          let mut rng = self.rng.lock().unwrap();
          for i in 0..self.gamma.len() {
              let g = self.gamma[i];
              let damping = -g * data.qvel[i];
              let z: f64 = StandardNormal.sample(&mut *rng);
              let noise = (2.0 * g * self.k_b_t / h).sqrt() * z;
              data.qfrc_passive[i] += damping + noise;
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- **Cross-item interaction surfaced — affects item 8**: Whether the
  thermostat lives inside sim-core or in a new sibling L0 crate
  (`sim-thermostat`) is item 8's question, not item 4's. But item 4
  determines that **wherever it lives, that crate gains `rand`,
  `rand_chacha`, and `rand_distr` as production deps**. If sim-core,
  that's a sim-core API surface change. If a sibling crate, the deps
  stay isolated and sim-core remains rand-free in production. Item 8
  should be answered with this trade-off explicitly in mind, not as a
  follow-on default.
- **DECISION (user confirmed)**: **Scheme B — `ChaCha8Rng`**. Concrete
  PRNG type for the thermostat is `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng`, seeded
  via `seed_from_u64`, wrapped in `Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>` for the
  `cb_passive` `Fn` constraint. Gaussian draws via
  `rand_distr::StandardNormal`, with the `(2γkT/h)^{1/2}` scale applied
  outside the sample (per-DOF γ, per-step h). The recommendation in
  this entry is now the answer.
- **DECISION (user confirmed) on item 8 lookahead**: **"Keep sim-core
  rand-free" enters item 8 as a heavy constraint, not a tiebreaker.**
  Item 8 is not resolved here, but the leading candidate is a sibling
  L0 crate (`sim-thermostat`) that depends on sim-core and bolts in
  via `cb_passive`. Reasoning: sim-core's identity is "deterministic
  physics anchor"; the readability-first / narrow-crates / R34
  bolt-on-aftermarket philosophy points the same direction; technical
  cost of one more crate is low (the workspace already has 7 sim-L0
  crates); and the dep-graph property "if you don't depend on
  sim-thermostat, your simulation is rand-free" is exactly the kind
  of architecture-from-types property that pays off for beginners
  reading the codebase. Item 8 will weigh this against any
  counter-evidence found during its own recon, but the default
  direction is now set.
- **Item 4 RESOLVED.** PRNG conventions catalogued, two schemes
  compared, Scheme B selected, item-8 constraint set. No code
  written, no Cargo.toml touched yet — those happen during Phase 1
  spec implementation, not recon.
- **Next action**: Phase-1-blocking recon item 5 — `Data::qfrc_passive`
  public mutability. Verify the field is `pub` so `cb_passive`'s
  `&mut Data` can write into it directly. Should be a quick check.

### 2026-04-09 (part 7) — Item 5: `Data::qfrc_passive` public mutability

- **Trigger**: Recon item 5, the smallest of the Phase-1-blocking items.
  Listed in part 3 as "probably fine since other passive fields are
  pub, but verify before drafting the spec." Single-question check.
- **Question**: Is `Data::qfrc_passive` declared `pub` so the
  `cb_passive` callback (which receives `&mut Data`) can write into it
  directly via `data.qfrc_passive[i] += ...`, or is it crate-private
  with no public mutator?
- **Finding**: **Yes — `pub qfrc_passive: DVector<f64>`** at
  `sim/L0/core/src/types/data.rs:158`. Direct field-access mutation is
  supported and is the only intended access path; there is no
  setter/mutator method shadowing it.
- **Bonus context — the entire "Forces in Generalized Coordinates"
  block is uniformly public** (`data.rs:152-172`):
  - `pub qfrc_applied`     (line 154)
  - `pub qfrc_bias`        (line 156)
  - `pub qfrc_passive`     (line 158)
  - `pub qfrc_spring`      (line 161)
  - `pub qfrc_damper`      (line 164)
  - `pub qfrc_fluid`       (line 167)
  - `pub qfrc_gravcomp`    (line 170)
  - `pub qfrc_constraint`  (line 172)

  The codebase convention for `Data` is "fields are public, callers
  read and write directly." This is consistent with the MuJoCo origin
  (mjData fields are all public C struct members) and with the
  `Injector::QfrcApplied` pattern in ml-bridge (item 3 part 5), which
  writes `data.qfrc_applied[i] = ...` directly. The thermostat writing
  `data.qfrc_passive[i] += ...` matches this convention exactly.
- **Sub-observation — the spring/damper/fluid/gravcomp split**: All
  the *component* passive fields (`qfrc_spring`, `qfrc_damper`,
  `qfrc_fluid`, `qfrc_gravcomp`) are also `pub`. They are aggregated
  into `qfrc_passive` at `forward/passive.rs:681` *before* `cb_passive`
  fires (`passive.rs:719`, per part 4). The thermostat writes into
  the *aggregated* `qfrc_passive` field after the engine has finished
  populating it from springs/dampers/fluid/gravcomp — never into a
  component field. Writing into a component field would be a category
  error (component fields have specific physical meanings) and would
  also be wrong on the timing (the aggregation has already happened).
  Part 4's design choice is reaffirmed; no surprise here.
- **No surprises**. Item 5 was expected to be a quick yes-or-no check
  and it was. The only thing worth flagging is that the spec should
  state explicitly *which* field the thermostat writes into
  (`qfrc_passive`, the aggregated post-spring/damper field) and *why*
  (cb_passive fires after aggregation — the aggregated field is the
  only correct write target).
- **Implication for the Phase 1 spec**: One sentence in the API
  section ("Writes via `data.qfrc_passive[i] += ...`; field is
  declared `pub` at `data.rs:158`; no setter required.") and one
  sentence in the design rationale ("Writes the *aggregated*
  `qfrc_passive` field, not the component spring/damper/fluid/gravcomp
  fields, because `cb_passive` fires after aggregation
  (`passive.rs:681,719`).") That's it.
- **Item 5 RESOLVED.** No design changes; a documentation hook for the
  spec is the only output.
- **Next action**: Phase-1-blocking recon item 6 — `model.timestep`
  variability across steps. Question: is `model.timestep` ever changed
  during a simulation, or is it set once at model init and held
  constant? The thermostat reads `h = model.timestep` inside
  `cb_passive` to scale the noise as `(2γkT/h)^{1/2}`. If `h` can
  change between steps, the thermostat is correct. If it can't, the
  `(2γkT/h)^{1/2}` factor could be precomputed once and cached at
  install time, eliminating a sqrt per step per DOF. Performance is
  negligible at Phase 1's nv=1, but the answer also affects the
  `LangevinThermostat` constructor signature (does it take `h`, or
  read it from the model?).

### 2026-04-09 (part 8) — Item 6: `model.timestep` variability across steps

- **Trigger**: Recon item 6 under sharpen-the-axe. Affects whether the
  thermostat reads `h = model.timestep` fresh inside `cb_passive` every
  step or precomputes the scale at install time.
- **Field declaration**: `pub timestep: f64` at
  `sim/L0/core/src/types/model.rs:828`. Plain public field, no setter
  shadowing it. (A second `timestep` field exists at `model.rs:1105`
  on `LengthRangeOpt`, but that's a length-range computation option
  unrelated to the main `Model::timestep`.)
- **Catalog of every write site in the workspace** (categorized):
  1. **Defaults / construction** (set once, never touched again):
     - `sim/L0/types/src/config.rs:32,56,65,76` — Config presets
       (240Hz, 60Hz, 1000Hz, 30Hz).
     - `sim/L0/core/src/types/model.rs:1123` —
       `LengthRangeOpt::default` (different field).
     - `sim/L0/core/src/types/model_init.rs:330` — Default model init
       value (500Hz, 0.002s).
     - `sim/L0/core/src/types/model_factories.rs:132,240,331` — Model
       factory presets (240Hz).
     - `sim/L0/mjcf/src/types.rs:513` — MJCF default.
     - `sim/L0/mjcf/src/builder/init.rs:144` — MJCF builder init.
     - `sim/L0/mjcf/src/builder/mod.rs:772` — Builder copying option
       into model.
     - `sim/L0/mjcf/src/parser.rs:246` — MJCF parser writing into
       option struct.
  2. **Test fixtures setting timestep before any stepping starts**:
     - `sim/L0/core/src/forward/fiber.rs` × 6 (all
       `model.timestep = 0.001`).
     - `sim/L0/core/src/constraint/jacobian.rs` × 2.
     - `sim/L0/core/src/jacobian/mod.rs` × 7.
  3. **Validation tests setting an invalid value to assert rejection**:
     - `sim/L0/types/src/config.rs:485,488,491` — `-0.01`, `0.0`, NaN.
     - `sim/L0/mjcf/src/validation.rs:804,811,818,825` — same pattern.
     - `sim/L0/tests/integration/split_step.rs:126` —
       `model.timestep = 0.0` to test the `step1()` error path
       (already seen in item 3 part 5).
  4. **Internal sub-component sync** (NOT `Model::timestep` itself):
     - `sim/L0/core/src/forward/muscle.rs:134` — `lr_model.timestep =
       opt.timestep;` writes a temporary length-range solver model,
       not the user's main model.
- **Crucial finding**: **There is no site in the codebase where
  `Model::timestep` is mutated *between* steps during a running
  simulation.** Every write is either init/default, test-fixture
  pre-setup, or validation-test invalid-value injection. The field is
  *de facto constant after model init*. The codebase convention is
  "set once, leave alone."
- **No compile-time enforcement, however**. The field is `pub` and
  freely mutable. Any user with `&mut Model` can rewrite it between
  steps. The codebase simply doesn't do this. There is no documented
  policy *because there is no usage pattern that needs one*.
- **Implication for the thermostat**: The cb_passive callback receives
  `&Model` (immutable) and `&mut Data`. It can read `model.timestep`
  for free every step. Two schemes for how to use it:
  - **Scheme A — read fresh every step**: thermostat reads
    `h = model.timestep` inside `cb_passive`, computes
    `(2γkT/h)^{1/2}` per draw. Current API sketch matches this.
    - Pros: Robust to any user manipulation (legal but
      unconventional). Constructor stays simple — no `h` parameter.
      Matches the cb_passive idiom (the callback already gets
      `&Model`; using it costs nothing). One extra `f64` read +
      sqrt per DOF per step.
    - Cons: One sqrt per DOF per step that *could* be precomputed.
  - **Scheme B — cache at install time**: thermostat captures `h` in
    its constructor (or `install()`) and stores the per-DOF scale
    `sigma_i = (2γ_i kT/h)^{1/2}` as a `DVector<f64>`. The hot path
    becomes one multiply per DOF per step, no sqrt.
    - Pros: One sqrt per DOF saved per step.
    - Cons: Becomes silently wrong if the user mutates
      `model.timestep` after install. Constructor needs `h` as input,
      OR `install()` needs to read it from the model — adds an
      `install`-time read that has its own ordering hazard ("what if
      the user installs the thermostat *before* setting timestep?").
- **Performance accounting**: Phase 1 is `nv=1` and runs 10⁵ steps.
  At Scheme A's cost of one sqrt + one read per DOF per step, that's
  10⁵ sqrts total — order of microseconds on any modern CPU,
  negligible compared to the constraint solver + RNG draws. Even at
  Phase 4 (8 coupled bistable elements, maybe `nv ~ 8-16`), the cost
  is 10⁶-ish sqrts over a 10⁵-step run — still negligible. The
  precompute is a true micro-optimization at every plausible phase
  scale.
- **Recommendation: Scheme A — read fresh every step**. Reasoning:
  1. The cost is negligible at every plausible phase scale (Phase
     1–7). Optimizing it is premature; the cost of being wrong is
     not.
  2. Robustness against user mutation is free at this cost. A user
     who legally rewrites `model.timestep` between steps gets correct
     physics from the thermostat, not silently wrong physics.
  3. Constructor stays minimal: `LangevinThermostat::new(gamma,
     k_b_t, seed)` — three parameters, no `h`. Simpler API,
     simpler tests.
  4. No install-order hazard. The thermostat doesn't care when the
     timestep is set, only that it's set when `cb_passive` fires.
  5. Matches the cb_passive idiom: the callback gets `&Model` for a
     reason; using it is the correct pattern. Caching would defeat
     the purpose of the callback receiving the model.
  6. **Loud failure beats silent failure** — same reasoning as item
     2 part 3 and item 4 part 6. Scheme B's failure mode (silent
     wrong physics after a `model.timestep` mutation) is exactly
     the class sharpen-the-axe forbids.
- **Confidence**: high. This is a low-stakes decision (the costs of
  both schemes are well below noise floor), but the principled
  choice still points to A.
- **Implication for the spec**: Document that the thermostat reads
  `h = model.timestep` inside `cb_passive` every step, and that this
  is by design — it's robust to legal-but-unusual user mutation of
  `model.timestep` between steps, and the cost is negligible. State
  that the codebase convention is "set once, leave alone" (no
  in-tree write site mutates timestep mid-simulation), but that the
  thermostat doesn't depend on the convention — it would still be
  correct if the convention were broken.
- **DECISION (user confirmed)**: **Scheme A — read fresh every step.**
  User cited Scheme B's silent-failure potential as the deciding
  factor — same reasoning as item 2 part 3, item 4 part 6, and the
  reasoning in this entry. Loud failure beats silent failure
  consistently across the recon line.
- **Item 6 RESOLVED.** Thermostat reads `h = model.timestep` inside
  `cb_passive` every step. Constructor signature is
  `LangevinThermostat::new(gamma, k_b_t, seed)` — no `h` parameter.
  No code, no spec, no Cargo.toml touched.
- **Next action**: Phase-1-blocking
  recon item 7 — statistical-test infrastructure conventions in
  `sim/L0/tests/`. Question: how does the existing test suite
  structure conformance/numerical tests, and what assertion
  patterns + tolerance idioms are in use? Determines where the
  Phase 1 equipartition test lives, what test crate it joins, and
  what shape its assertions take.

### 2026-04-09 (part 9) — Item 7: test infrastructure conventions

- **Trigger**: Recon item 7 under sharpen-the-axe. Determines test
  crate location, file structure, model-construction idiom, naming
  convention, tolerance idiom, and where the new equipartition test
  lives.
- **Test crate**: `sim-conformance-tests` at `sim/L0/tests/`
  (`sim/L0/tests/Cargo.toml`). One workspace test crate, two
  `[[test]]` targets:
  - `mujoco_conformance` (path `mujoco_conformance/mod.rs`) — golden
    conformance tests against MuJoCo reference outputs.
  - `integration` (path `integration/mod.rs`) — every other sim
    integration test (collision, equality constraints, integrators,
    sensors, actuators, callbacks, etc.).

  Deps: `sim-mjcf`, `sim-urdf`, `sim-core`, `sim-types`, `nalgebra`,
  `approx`. **No `rand` / `rand_chacha` / `rand_distr` in the test
  crate's deps.** Adding statistical tests will need to add these
  (or pull them transitively via the `sim-thermostat` crate from
  item 8).
- **Convention 1 — model construction is by MJCF XML, not direct Rust
  construction**. Every callback test (`tests/integration/callbacks.rs`)
  and almost every passive test (`tests/integration/passive_forces.rs`)
  builds models like:
  ```rust
  let xml = r#"
  <mujoco>
    <option gravity="0 0 0"/>
    <worldbody>...</worldbody>
  </mujoco>"#;
  let mut model = sim_mjcf::load_model(xml).expect("load");
  ```
  This is the dominant idiom; direct `Model::n_link_pendulum(...)`
  construction (used in `split_step.rs`) is the exception. The
  thermostat's 1-DOF damped harmonic oscillator should be expressed
  as MJCF XML to match convention.
- **Convention 2 — naming**. `^fn test_` prefix is dominant: 582
  matches across 23 files in `tests/integration/`. The non-prefixed
  style (`fn passive_callback_adds_force()` in callbacks.rs) is an
  outlier in a small subset of files. **Thermostat tests should use
  `test_` prefix** to match the dominant convention.
- **Convention 3 — tolerance assertions use `approx::assert_relative_eq!`**.
  20+ files import `approx::assert_relative_eq` and use the
  `epsilon = X` form:
  ```rust
  assert_relative_eq!(data.qpos[0], 0.5, epsilon = 0.05);
  ```
  Some files mix in plain `(actual - expected).abs() < epsilon`
  patterns for one-off tolerance checks (e.g., `callbacks.rs:39`).
  Both are accepted; `assert_relative_eq!` is the dominant idiom.
- **Convention 4 — doc comments per test explaining intent**. Every
  test in `callbacks.rs` and `passive_forces.rs` has a `///` doc
  comment explaining what is being verified, often including the
  MuJoCo physics reference being tested. Convention.
- **Adjacent test files for the thermostat — natural neighbors**:
  - `tests/integration/callbacks.rs` (DT-79) — already tests
    `cb_passive`, `cb_control`, `cb_contactfilter`, `cb_sensor`. The
    natural home for *infrastructure* tests on the thermostat
    (callback fires once per step, RNG advances by expected count,
    install/clear lifecycle, etc.).
  - `tests/integration/passive_forces.rs` — tests existing passive
    physics (springs, damping, friction loss). The natural physics
    neighborhood; the equipartition test could conceptually live
    here, though it's substantial enough to deserve its own file.
  - **Recommended new file**: `tests/integration/langevin_thermostat.rs`,
    registered in `tests/integration/mod.rs` as
    `pub mod langevin_thermostat;`. Holds the equipartition test +
    callback-firing-count test + reproducibility-from-seed test +
    parameter sweeps. Big enough as a test surface to deserve its
    own file; small enough to live as one file rather than a
    subdirectory.
- **CORRECTION to part 5 (item 3)**: Part 5 claimed *"The thermostat
  will be the workspace's first `cb_passive` consumer ... nothing in
  `sim/`, `examples/`, or any test currently uses it."* That was
  **partially wrong**. `tests/integration/callbacks.rs` already has:
  - `passive_callback_adds_force` (line 11) — unit test that
    `cb_passive` fires and writes to `qfrc_passive`.
  - `clone_with_callbacks` (line 148) — unit test that cloning a
    Model preserves the passive callback.
  - `none_callbacks_no_effect` (line 117) — sanity check.

  These are **unit tests of the cb_passive API itself**, not
  production consumers. The corrected claim: the thermostat will be
  the workspace's **first stateful `cb_passive` consumer**, and its
  first production consumer. The unit tests in callbacks.rs prove
  the API works; they do not exercise the *stateful* + *Mutex<RNG>*
  patterns the thermostat needs. Worth flagging for accuracy in
  future references back to part 5.
- **Genuine new finding 1 — no existing statistical-sampling tests
  in the workspace**. Verified by greps for `n_samples`,
  `sample_mean`, `0..100000`, `mean +/=`, `chi-square`, etc. The
  `0..10000` loops in `passive_forces.rs:358,672`,
  `model_data_pipeline.rs:280`, `validation.rs:1480`, and
  `collision_primitives.rs:1743` are all *time-evolution* loops
  (run the simulation forward), not Monte Carlo sample loops.
  No test in `sim/L0/tests/` averages a quantity over many samples
  and compares against a theoretical statistical value. **The
  thermostat's equipartition test will be the workspace's first
  statistical-sampling validation test.**
  - Implication: there is **no convention to inherit** for
    statistical assertions. The thermostat must establish one. The
    Phase 1 spec needs to think about whether `approx::assert_relative_eq!`
    is the right tool (probably not — it tests relative error, not
    sampling error) or whether to roll a small helper like
    `assert_within_sampling_error!(actual, expected, n_samples,
    expected_relative_std)` that captures the statistical-tolerance
    intuition. This is a Phase 1 spec design question, not a recon
    question.
  - Implication: the thermostat test sets the *style* for all
    future statistical validation in the thermo line — Phase 2
    (free + articulated body equipartition), Phase 3 (Kramers
    rate), Phase 4 (Ising/Gibbs joint distribution), Phase 5 (EBM
    target match). All of them will need similar statistical
    assertion infrastructure. Worth designing it deliberately at
    Phase 1, not stumbling into it.
- **Genuine new finding 2 — `Model::clone()` preserves passive
  callbacks AND shares captured state across clones**. This is the
  most important finding from item 7 and it surfaces a Phase 1 spec
  API design question. **`callbacks.rs::clone_with_callbacks`
  (lines 148-186) proves it explicitly**:
  ```rust
  let called = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
  let called_clone = Arc::clone(&called);
  model.set_passive_callback(move |_model, data| {
      called_clone.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
      data.qfrc_passive[0] += 1.0;
  });
  let model2 = model.clone();           // ← clone here
  data.forward(&model2).expect("forward");
  assert!(called.load(Ordering::SeqCst));  // ← shared Arc fired
  ```
  The captured `Arc<AtomicBool>` is observed to be set via the
  cloned model's callback firing. Therefore the closure is shared
  (or at least its captured state is) between the original and the
  clone. **Implication for the thermostat**: a user who builds a
  Model, installs a `LangevinThermostat` (which captures
  `Arc<LangevinThermostat>`), then clones the Model N times for N
  parallel envs gets:
  - **Shared `Arc<LangevinThermostat>` across all clones**.
  - **Shared `Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>` across all clones**.
  - **Shared RNG stream** — sample 1 goes to env 0, sample 2 to
    env 5, sample 3 to env 2, etc., based on whatever order the
    parallel envs happen to call the callback. **This is wrong
    physics** — each env's noise stream should be statistically
    independent, not interleaved with all the others.
  - **Mutex contention** on every `cb_passive` invocation across
    every parallel env. Performance disaster at high env counts.
- **Why this is a Phase 1 spec question, not a Phase 1 *implementation*
  problem**: Phase 1 itself is single-env (1-DOF DHO equipartition).
  No clone, no BatchSim, no problem. But the API the thermostat
  exposes in Phase 1 will set the pattern that BatchSim users in
  Phase 2+ will follow. If we ship a `LangevinThermostat::install`
  that silently breaks under clone, BatchSim users will hit it
  cold. Sharpen-the-axe says we surface this *now* and design the
  API with the answer in mind, even if Phase 1 doesn't exercise it.
- **Three possible API responses (sketches only — not deciding
  here)**:
  - **(A)** Document loudly that the user must install a *fresh*
    `LangevinThermostat` on each cloned model, *after* cloning.
    Pure documentation, no code change. Risk: silent footgun,
    exactly the failure mode sharpen-the-axe forbids.
  - **(B)** Provide a paired API:
    `LangevinThermostat::install_per_env(Arc<Model>, n_envs: usize,
    seed_base: u64) -> Vec<Arc<Model>>` that builds N models from
    one prototype, installs N independent thermostats with seeds
    derived from `seed_base`, returns the N models. Forces correct
    usage at the API level. Cost: more API surface, requires Arc
    rewrap.
  - **(C)** Provide a `LangevinThermostat::for_clone(seed: u64) ->
    LangevinThermostat` helper that the user calls explicitly after
    each clone, plus loud documentation. Middle ground.
  - **(D)** Investigate whether `set_passive_callback` could be
    redesigned to take a *factory* (`impl Fn() -> Box<dyn Fn...>`)
    that runs at clone time and produces a fresh closure per clone.
    Most invasive — touches sim-core's callback infrastructure.
    Probably out of scope for Phase 1; flag for the thermostat-and-
    BatchSim spec interaction.

  This list is *not* a decision; it's the option space the spec
  needs to consider. Item 8 (where the thermostat lives) and the
  Phase 1 spec design will weigh these against each other.

- **Caveat (caveat 3) from part 4 status updated**: Previously
  framed as "BatchSim parallel envs need their own
  `LangevinThermostat` instance — not a shared one — to keep RNG
  streams independent and avoid lock contention. The API should
  make the wrong choice hard." After item 7's finding, it's
  upgraded from "user discipline issue" to "easy-to-trigger
  silent footgun under the natural BatchSim workflow (clone the
  model)." The Phase 1 spec must address it explicitly, not just
  mention it.
- **Item 7 RESOLVED on its actual question** (test conventions
  catalogued, file structure clear, naming and tolerance idioms
  documented, the thermostat tests have a clear home). **Two
  side-findings flagged**: the statistical-test precedent void,
  and the clone-preserves-callback footgun. Neither blocks Phase
  1 implementation; both are inputs to the Phase 1 spec design.
- **Did NOT yet draft**: any code, any spec, any Cargo.toml
  changes.
- **Next action**: Phase-1-blocking recon item 8 — where the
  thermostat module lives (sim-core submodule vs. sibling L0 crate
  vs. inside a new crate). With item 4's "keep sim-core rand-free"
  constraint already set as heavy, the leading candidate is a new
  L0 crate (`sim-thermostat`). Item 8 will weigh this against any
  counter-evidence (e.g., does sim-core's `cb_passive` API expose
  enough surface for an external crate to install a callback?
  needs verification).

### 2026-04-09 (part 10) — Item 8: thermostat module location

- **Trigger**: Recon item 8 under sharpen-the-axe. Item 4 already
  set "keep sim-core rand-free" as a heavy constraint and named the
  leading candidate (a sibling L0 crate `sim-thermostat`). Item 8
  exists to verify the public-API compatibility, name the location
  precisely, and surface any counter-evidence.
- **Question**: Does sim-core's `cb_passive` API expose enough
  *public* surface for an *external* crate to install a callback,
  with no need to access sim-core-private types?
- **Verification — every required type and method is `pub`**:
  - `Model::set_passive_callback<F>(&mut self, f: F)` at
    `sim/L0/core/src/types/model.rs:1237-1243` — public, generic,
    bound `F: Fn(&Self, &mut Data) + Send + Sync + 'static`. The
    setter constructs the internal `Callback(Arc<dyn Fn...>)`
    wrapper itself; **external crates never need to mention
    `CbPassive` or `Callback` types directly**.
  - `Model::clear_passive_callback(&mut self)` at `model.rs:1246`
    — public.
  - `Model` re-exported at `sim/L0/core/src/lib.rs:219` →
    `sim_core::Model`.
  - `Data` re-exported at `lib.rs:192` → `sim_core::Data`.
  - `DVector<f64>` re-exported via
    `pub use nalgebra::{DMatrix, DVector, ...}` at `lib.rs:257` →
    `sim_core::DVector`.
  - `Data::qfrc_passive` is `pub` (item 5 part 7).
  - `Model::timestep` is `pub` (item 6 part 8).

  **An external `sim-thermostat` crate can do everything it needs
  through `sim_core`'s public API with no friction.** No
  sim-core-private types are required, no sim-core code changes
  are required, no `pub(crate)` widening is required.

- **Type-level confirmation of the closure bound**: The thermostat's
  `Arc<LangevinThermostat>` (where `LangevinThermostat` contains
  `gamma: DVector<f64>`, `k_b_t: f64`, `rng: Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>`) is:
  - `Send + Sync`: `DVector<f64>` is Send + Sync; `f64` is
    Send + Sync; `Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>` is Send + Sync because
    `ChaCha8Rng: Send` (its state is plain bytes). ✓
  - `'static`: it owns all its state, no borrows. ✓
  - The closure `move |m, d| me.apply(m, d)` (where `me:
    Arc<LangevinThermostat>`) therefore satisfies
    `Fn(&Model, &mut Data) + Send + Sync + 'static`. ✓
- **Wrapper-type confirmation of the clone footgun**: Looking at
  `set_passive_callback`'s body:
  ```rust
  self.cb_passive = Some(super::callbacks::Callback(std::sync::Arc::new(f)));
  ```
  The closure is wrapped in `Arc<dyn Fn...>` *inside* sim-core. So
  `Model::clone()` clones the outer `Callback` struct, which clones
  the inner `Arc`, which is a pointer-copy — both Models point at
  the same closure object. The closure's `move`-captured
  `Arc<LangevinThermostat>` is therefore physically shared between
  original and clone, which means the `Mutex<ChaCha8Rng>` is shared.
  **The clone footgun from item 7 is now confirmed at the type
  level**, not just observed via the test in `clone_with_callbacks`.
- **Existing sim/L0 sibling layout** (verified by directory listing):
  ```
  sim/L0/types       → sim-types
  sim/L0/simd        → sim-simd
  sim/L0/core        → sim-core
  sim/L0/gpu         → sim-gpu
  sim/L0/mjcf        → sim-mjcf
  sim/L0/urdf        → sim-urdf
  sim/L0/tests       → sim-conformance-tests
  sim/L0/ml-bridge   → sim-ml-bridge
  ```
  **8 existing sim/L0 sibling crates**. Naming convention is
  single-word lowercase (`types`, `simd`, `core`, `gpu`, `mjcf`,
  `urdf`) with hyphen for compound names (`ml-bridge`,
  `conformance-tests`). Package names are `sim-{dirname}`.
  **A new `sim/L0/thermostat/` → `sim-thermostat` fits cleanly.**
- **Two schemes compared** (per "Two schemes, then choose"):
  - **Scheme α — sim-core submodule**: Add a `thermostat`
    submodule at `sim/L0/core/src/thermostat.rs` (or alongside
    `forward/passive.rs`). Promote `rand`, `rand_chacha`,
    `rand_distr` from dev-deps to production deps in
    `sim/L0/core/Cargo.toml`. Re-export `LangevinThermostat` from
    `sim/L0/core/src/lib.rs`.
    - **Pros**: One fewer crate. Colocation with the integration
      point (`cb_passive`, `qfrc_passive`, `forward/passive.rs`).
      Discoverable: a reader of sim-core sees the thermostat
      naturally.
    - **Cons**: Promotes `rand` + `rand_chacha` + `rand_distr` to
      production deps of sim-core. **sim-core's identity changes
      from "deterministic physics anchor" to "physics anchor with
      stochastic infrastructure."** Every consumer of sim-core
      (sim-mjcf, sim-urdf, sim-ml-bridge, sim-conformance-tests,
      sim-bevy, every example, every downstream user) inherits the
      `rand` dep tree transitively, *whether or not they use the
      thermostat*. Violates item 4's heavy constraint.
  - **Scheme β — sibling L0 crate `sim-thermostat`**: New crate at
    `sim/L0/thermostat/` with `Cargo.toml` declaring `sim-core`,
    `nalgebra`, `rand`, `rand_chacha`, `rand_distr` as deps.
    `LangevinThermostat::install` takes `&mut sim_core::Model` and
    calls `model.set_passive_callback(...)`. sim-core stays
    rand-free in production.
    - **Pros**: sim-core's identity is preserved
      (deterministic-by-default, rand-free). Dep tree property
      "if you don't depend on sim-thermostat, your sim is rand-free"
      is observable from the dep graph alone — the kind of
      readability-from-types property that beginners benefit from.
      Aligns with the workspace's existing 8-crate sibling layout
      and the user's stated "narrow crates over monoliths"
      preference. Future companion features (Phase 2 free-body
      thermostat, Phase 3 bistable element library, Phase 4
      coupled-array thermostat) get a natural home alongside
      `LangevinThermostat`. Item 4's constraint is honored.
    - **Cons**: One more crate to maintain (Cargo.toml, lib.rs,
      lints, dev-deps). Discoverability slightly worse — a reader
      of sim-core won't see the thermostat without browsing
      siblings. (Mitigated by a one-line "see also" comment in
      sim-core's `forward/passive.rs:719` near the `cb_passive`
      invocation site, and by the spec / master plan.)
- **Recommendation: Scheme β — `sim-thermostat` sibling crate**.
  Confidence: high. Reasoning condensed:
  1. Item 4's heavy constraint is unambiguous: keep sim-core
     rand-free. Putting the thermostat in sim-core directly
     violates it.
  2. The public-API surface verification proves there is **zero
     technical friction** to the sibling-crate approach. No
     `pub(crate)` widening, no callback infrastructure changes,
     no sim-core code edits required.
  3. The R34 / narrow-crates / readability-from-types philosophy
     points the same direction (item 4 part 6 already documented
     this).
  4. The "one fewer crate" pro of Scheme α is real but small —
     the workspace already has 8 sibling sim-L0 crates, so the
     marginal cost of a 9th is well-amortized.
  5. The discoverability con of Scheme β is mitigable with one
     "see also" comment in sim-core and proper documentation in
     the master plan + Phase 1 spec.
- **Concrete location**: New crate at `sim/L0/thermostat/` with
  package name `sim-thermostat`. Files at Phase 1 implementation
  time:
  ```
  sim/L0/thermostat/
  ├── Cargo.toml         # deps: sim-core, nalgebra, rand,
  │                      #       rand_chacha, rand_distr
  └── src/
      └── lib.rs         # pub struct LangevinThermostat
                         # impl LangevinThermostat { new, install,
                         #                           clear, ... }
  ```
  **One file is enough at Phase 1 scale**. Phase 2+ may add
  submodules (`free_body.rs`, `articulated.rs`) as needed; the
  crate-as-collection-point gives them a home.
- **Test location — flagged for the Phase 1 spec, not decided here**:
  Three options for where the thermostat tests live:
  - **(α)** Inside `sim-thermostat/tests/` as integration tests of
    the sibling crate. Pro: tests with code, deps isolated. Con:
    diverges from the "all sim integration tests in
    sim-conformance-tests" convention.
  - **(β)** In `sim-conformance-tests` as
    `tests/integration/langevin_thermostat.rs` (per item 7
    recommendation). Pro: matches convention. Con:
    `sim-conformance-tests` gains `sim-thermostat` as a dep (and
    transitively `rand`/`rand_chacha`/`rand_distr`).
  - **(γ)** Hybrid: API/lifecycle/seeding tests in
    `sim-thermostat/tests/`, equipartition + cross-physics
    integration tests in `sim-conformance-tests`. Pro: each test
    lives where it makes most sense. Con: two homes, slightly
    worse discoverability.

  This is a Phase 1 spec design question, not a recon question.
  Item 8 is resolved on the *code* location; the *test* location
  goes in the spec.
- **DECISION (user confirmed)**: **Scheme β — `sim-thermostat`
  sibling crate at `sim/L0/thermostat/`**. Item 4's "keep sim-core
  rand-free" constraint is honored; the public-API surface is
  sufficient (no sim-core changes required); the sibling layout
  matches the existing 8 sim/L0 crates.
- **Item 8 RESOLVED.** Thermostat code will live in
  `sim/L0/thermostat/` as a new sibling L0 crate (`sim-thermostat`),
  depending on `sim-core`, `nalgebra`, `rand`, `rand_chacha`,
  `rand_distr`. sim-core stays rand-free in production.
- **Did NOT yet draft**: any code, any spec, any Cargo.toml
  changes, any new directories.
- **Phase-1-blocking recon round complete.** Item
  list status:
  - Item 2 — RESOLVED (part 3, then superseded by part 4).
  - Item 3 — RESOLVED (part 4 + part 5).
  - Item 4 — RESOLVED (part 6).
  - Item 5 — RESOLVED (part 7).
  - Item 6 — RESOLVED (part 8).
  - Item 7 — RESOLVED (part 9).
  - Item 8 — RESOLVED (this entry).

  Once item 8 is confirmed, the next action is **drafting the
  Phase 1 spec** (`docs/thermo_computing/PHASE_1_LANGEVIN_THERMOSTAT_SPEC.md`).
  All inputs are now collected. The spec needs to address:
  1. The base algorithm (Euler-Maruyama Langevin) and the
     equipartition validation gate.
  2. Composition section (field disjointness with RL writers,
     per part 5).
  3. Test section (callback-firing-count + equipartition + seed
     reproducibility, per part 7).
  4. **Statistical-test infrastructure design** — how the
     equipartition test asserts sample-mean-within-tolerance, and
     what shape the helper macro/fn takes (per part 9 finding 1).
  5. **Clone footgun resolution** — which of options A-D from
     part 9 finding 2 the spec adopts, and how the API enforces
     it (per part 9 finding 2).
  6. Cadence section (plain `step()`, no split-step required,
     per part 5).
  7. PRNG choice (`ChaCha8Rng + StandardNormal`, per part 6) and
     the constructor signature (`new(gamma, k_b_t, seed)`, per
     part 8).
  8. Module location (`sim/L0/thermostat/`, per this entry).
  9. Phase 5+ caveats from part 4 (FD perturbation gating,
     plugin ordering, BatchSim per-env instances).
  10. The validation parameter set (M=1, k_spring=1, γ=0.1,
      k_B·T=1, h=0.001, 10⁵ steps after burn-in) and the
      γ + T sweep grid.

### 2026-04-09 (part 11) — Chassis design round complete

- **Trigger**: After the Phase-1-blocking recon round (items 2-8)
  closed in part 10, the user reframed the next step away from a
  monolithic Phase 1 spec and toward a *bolt-pattern design*
  document defining the swappable chassis of the `sim-thermostat`
  crate. The framing was R34-explicit: "we might decide to redo
  the entire thing, as long as the bolt patterns are the same,
  we can swap it." The reference architecture was named
  explicitly as `sim-ml-bridge`. A new artifact was opened:
  `docs/thermo_computing/THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md`.
- **Cadence**: Same sharpen-the-axe rhythm as the recon round
  (one decision at a time, two schemes per decision,
  recommendation + reasoning, user confirmation, log + commit),
  applied at the *design layer* instead of the code-reading
  layer.
- **Six chassis decisions resolved**:

  | # | Decision                  | Resolution                                                            |
  |---|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | 1 | Core trait shape          | `PassiveComponent` — broad, callback-shaped, no physics in the trait  |
  | 2 | Composition idiom         | `PassiveStack::builder().with(...).build().install(&mut model)`       |
  | 3 | Clone footgun resolution  | `install_per_env(prototype, n, build_one)` + defensive clear inside loop |
  | 4 | `Diagnose` trait surface  | Minimal: `diagnostic_summary -> String` only                          |
  | 5 | Public test utilities     | `WelfordOnline` (Welford 1962) + `assert_within_n_sigma` + `sample_stats` |
  | 6 | Crate layout              | Flat ml-bridge style: 5 source files + 1 test file at `sim/L0/thermostat/` |

  Full reasoning for each decision lives in
  [`THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md`](./THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md). The
  recon log entries here capture the *meta* — that the round
  happened, what it decided, what it found.
- **Side findings surfaced during chassis design**:
  - **Decision 5 — autocorrelation correction**: The recon log
    part 2 claim of "10⁻² sampling tolerance for 10⁵ samples"
    was off by ~10× because samples from the Markov chain are
    correlated. Effective N ≈ 10, not 10⁵. The `§The Gap Phase 1
    Validation` paragraph above now carries the corrected
    calculation and a note that the Phase 1 spec will choose
    between three fixes (α/β/γ).
  - **Decision 3 — clone footgun resolved at chassis level**:
    Item 7 / part 9 flagged the `Model::clone()` callback-
    sharing footgun as needing Phase 1 spec resolution. Now
    resolved at the chassis level (not the spec level) via
    `PassiveStack::install_per_env`. The part 9 entry above
    now carries an "update" note pointing to Decision 3.
  - **Total chassis surface estimate**: ~790 LOC across 8
    files (6 source + 1 integration test + 1 Cargo.toml).
    Comparable to a small ml-bridge algorithm + tests.
    Manageable, mechanical, swappable.
- **Why the chassis design round was a separate phase from
  spec drafting**: The user named the principle directly —
  "the implementation may be wrong, that's OK, AS LONG AS the
  bolt patterns are right." Designing the bolt patterns
  *first*, then implementing one component against them,
  produces a chassis that survives implementation surprises.
  The Phase 1 implementation is now allowed to inform a chassis
  revision if needed; the chassis is small enough (~320 LOC of
  trait + composer + diagnose + test_utils, per Decision 6's
  file inventory: 30 + 120 + 20 + 150) that revising it is a
  focused operation, not a rewrite.
- **Memory entry created during this round**:
  [Genuine agreement, not passive](feedback_genuine_agreement.md)
  — feedback memory established when the user noted that their
  string of confirmed recommendations was genuine agreement,
  not passive acceptance. Keep being decisive; don't water down
  recommendations to extract artificial pushback.
- **Did NOT yet draft**: any code, any Cargo.toml, any new
  directories. Six decisions are designed, none are
  implemented. The chassis is a paper artifact at the close of
  this entry.
- **Next action — IN A NEW SESSION**: draft the Phase 1 spec
  (`PHASE_1_LANGEVIN_THERMOSTAT_SPEC.md`) against the now-
  finalized chassis. The spec is small because the chassis
  answered everything except the validation parameter fix
  (α/β/γ). Estimated size ~300-500 lines, half-day of focused
  drafting. The new session should get a tailored prompt that
  references:
  - This master plan (with the chassis design round complete)
  - `THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md` for the bolt patterns
  - Decision 5's autocorrelation finding and the three fix
    options for the validation parameter set
  - The remaining sharpen-the-axe discipline for spec design

### 2026-04-09 (part 12) — Doc review pass: M1, M4, M5, M2, M3, S1

- **Trigger**: Reviewer pass (Claude Opus 4.6, 1M context) over
  `MASTER_PLAN.md` + `THERMO_CHASSIS_DESIGN.md`. Produced a
  15-item checklist (5 must-fix, 6 should-fix, 4 nits) recorded
  at `docs/thermo_computing/DOC_REVIEW_2026-04-09.md`. Items
  applied one at a time as separate commits on the branch
  `feature/thermo-doc-review`.
- **Cadence**: Same sharpen-the-axe rhythm — one item per
  commit, two-schemes-then-choose for design changes (M5 and
  M2), explicit acceptance criteria, user confirmation for the
  load-bearing chassis-altering items.
- **Items closed in this entry**:
  - **M1 — Phase 1 sampling-error tolerance wording fix**.
    The original `0.22 · (½kT) ≈ ±22%` phrasing was off by
    a factor of 2. Corrected to `(½kT)·√2/√10 ≈ 0.45·(½kT)`,
    i.e. ±45% of the expected mean for one trajectory; option
    (β) with 100 trajectories brings this to ±4.5% of `½kT`.
    Locked in a tolerance convention: tolerances are always
    expressed as a fraction of the expected mean, not as a
    fraction of `kT`. Commit `75d90de`.
  - **M4 — `Welford::reset()` and `merge()` added to chassis
    Decision 5**. Without `reset()`, the streaming-Welford
    burn-in story is broken. Without `merge()`, option (β)
    has to materialize per-trajectory means and re-Welford
    them. Both shipped in Phase 1; `merge` uses the
    Chan/Pébay parallel formula. `WelfordOnline` gains
    `#[derive(Clone)]`. Commit `031f777`.
  - **M5 — Type-enforce `PassiveComponent` write target**.
    Trait revised from `apply(&self, &Model, &mut Data)` to
    `apply(&self, &Model, &Data, &mut DVector<f64>)`. Data
    is now read-only; `qfrc_out` (length nv) is the only legal
    write target. `PassiveStack::install` allocates a scratch
    buffer per step, runs each component into it, and folds
    the result into `data.qfrc_passive` once at the end. The
    breaking change is free *right now* because no code has
    been written; after Phase 1 ships, the same change would
    be ripple-through painful. Same "loud over silent" line
    as items 2, 4, 6. Commit `9bc030b`.
  - **M2 — Decision 7: stochastic gating for FD/autograd**.
    The Phase 5+ caveat about `cb_passive` firing inside
    `forward_skip()` was previously punted. Doc review M2
    escalated it to a chassis-level decision because
    retrofitting trait shape at Phase 5 is breaking-change
    territory. Two-scheme analysis: Scheme A (orthogonal
    `Stochastic` opt-in trait + RAII `disable_stochastic()`
    guard) vs Scheme B (RNG snapshot/restore on
    `PassiveStack`). Scheme A confirmed. Every stochastic
    component on the roadmap has state-independent noise, so
    "disable noise during FD" gives the exactly-correct
    derivative `∂F_det/∂qpos`. Scheme B is documented as the
    additive future direction (`RngSnapshot` orthogonal trait)
    if a state-dependent noise component ever lands. Commit
    `034d9c8`.
  - **M3 — Q5 (cf-design end-to-end differentiability)
    escalated**. Q5 was previously a single-sentence
    deferred-to-Phase 5 entry. Doc review M3 escalated it to
    active foreground recon, scheduled in parallel with the
    Phase 1 spec drafting, on the asymmetric-risk argument.
    Discovering "no" after months of Phase 2-4 commitment is
    exactly the avoidable surprise sharpen-the-axe forbids.
    Recon scope named (cf-design autograd integration, SDF
    boolean differentiability, marching cubes vs smooth
    alternative, the cf-design Phase 5 differentiable-
    optimization spec). Recon log entry name reserved for when
    the recon actually starts. Commit `6ccc0ff`.
  - **S1 — Q3 (`thrml-rs` existence) resolved**. 5-minute web
    search. Answer is *"yes, but with caveats"*: original
    `extropic-ai/thrml` (JAX) exists, two community Rust
    ports exist on GitHub (`SashimiSaketoro/thrml-rs`,
    `Pingasmaster/thrml-rs`), neither officially maintained
    by Extropic, neither apparently on crates.io. Phase 6
    options refined from "exists / doesn't" binary to (A)
    depend on a port, (B) implement minimal native block-Gibbs
    (~few hundred LOC, leading direction, sharpen-the-axe
    consistent), (C) vendor / fork into a `sim-thrml` sibling
    crate. No commitment yet — Phase 6 spec will decide. The
    "5-minute web search" was the right move because deferring
    it preserved an artificial binary that hid the real
    three-option structure. This commit.
- **Aggregate effect on the chassis**:
  - Trait shape (Decision 1) revised twice: M5 added the
    scratch buffer signature, M2 added the `as_stochastic`
    introspection hook. Both additive and consistent.
  - Stack API (Decision 2) revised twice: M5 added the
    scratch-buffer install body, M2 added
    `set_all_stochastic` and `disable_stochastic` RAII guard.
  - Test utilities (Decision 5) gained `Welford::reset()` and
    `merge()` (M4).
  - File inventory: `component.rs` 30→70 LOC (Stochastic
    trait), `stack.rs` 120→160 LOC (gating + guard),
    `test_utils.rs` 150→170 LOC (reset + merge), total Phase
    1 footprint 790→890 LOC.
  - Decision count: 6→7. The chassis design round complete
    table now has 7 rows.
- **Open follow-ons after this entry** (the should-fix /
  nit items still on the doc review checklist):
  - S2 — Rewrite §3 Current State to reflect chassis-design-
    round outcome (or split master plan into two files).
  - S3 — Reconsider `install_per_env` return type
    (`Vec<Model>` vs `EnvBatch`).
  - S4 — Add "passive forces only" framing paragraph to
    chassis §0.
  - S5 — Call out D4's external dependencies (3D printer
    accuracy, measurement infrastructure).
  - S6 — Note thermostat persistence as a future direction.
  - N1-N4 — polish pass.
  - **Then**: draft the Phase 1 spec.
- **Did NOT yet draft**: any code, any Cargo.toml, any new
  directories. Doc review pass is paper-only by design.

### 2026-04-09 (part 13) — Q5: cf-design end-to-end differentiability — RESOLVED (NO, with caveats)

- **Trigger**: Doc review M3 (part 12) escalated Q5 from "deferred
  to Phase 5" to active foreground recon, on the asymmetric-risk
  argument: discovering "no" after months of Phase 2-4 commitment
  is exactly the avoidable surprise sharpen-the-axe forbids. This
  is the recon that closes the question. Recon scope was named
  in part 12: cf-design autograd integration, SDF boolean
  differentiability, marching cubes vs smooth alternative, the
  cf-design Phase 5 spec, and existing end-to-end gradient tests.
- **Verdict**: **NO**. The cf-design → sim-core parameter
  pipeline is *not* end-to-end differentiable. It is differentiable
  *up to* the SDF field level (analytically) and *no further*.
  Three concrete breaks downstream. The shipping Phase 5 design-
  through-physics optimization uses **finite differences over the
  full pipeline**, and the documentation says so explicitly.
- **What works** — analytic ∂f/∂θ at the SDF level:
  - `cf-design/src/param.rs` defines `ParamStore` (Arc-shared
    `RwLock<Vec<f64>>`) and `ParamRef` for naming scalar design
    variables. ~216 LOC, zero ML deps. Plain mutable f64 store.
  - `cf-design/src/param_gradient.rs` (~273 LOC) implements
    hand-rolled forward-mode AD over the `FieldNode` enum.
    Smooth booleans (`SmoothUnion`, `SmoothSubtract`,
    `SmoothIntersect`, `SmoothUnionAll`) carry full analytic
    chain-rule derivatives in θ, including the softmax-weighted
    `∂f/∂k` for the variable blend radius. Hard booleans
    (`Union`, `Subtract`, `Intersect`) follow the active child
    (correct subgradient, undefined exactly at the seam).
    Transforms (translate/rotate/scale/mirror/twist/bend/
    repeat) propagate via inverse pull-back. Tested against
    centered FD oracle to ε=1e-6 across 8+ unit tests
    (`param_gradient.rs:294-end`).
  - `cf-design/src/gradient.rs` (separate file) implements
    `∇f(p)` — the *spatial* gradient w.r.t. (x,y,z), used by
    dual contouring for vertex placement. Distinct from
    `param_gradient`; both are analytic, both forward-mode.
- **First break** — mesh extraction is topologically discrete:
  - `cf-design/src/mesher.rs:1` — "Marching cubes mesher with
    interval arithmetic pruning." Standard MC over a regular
    voxel grid; vertex/edge/face count changes discretely as θ
    crosses critical values. No smooth surrogate.
  - `cf-design/src/dual_contouring.rs:1-7` — manifold dual
    contouring with QEF vertex placement on the same regular
    voxel grid. Sharper features than MC, but still discrete
    sign-change topology. `adaptive_dc.rs` (1286 LOC) is the
    octree-adaptive variant — same fundamental break.
  - There is no differentiable marching cubes (DiffMC), no
    neural implicit surface extractor, no soft-occupancy mesher
    in the codebase. The cf-geometry::IndexedMesh that comes
    out the other side has no notion of θ-derivatives.
- **Second break** — mass properties are unwired:
  - `cf-design/src/mechanism/mass.rs:1-22` — `mass_properties`
    integrates `density · interior_indicator` over a regular
    grid with linear-fraction boundary weighting. Returns plain
    `f64` mass + `Point3<f64>` COM + `[f64; 6]` inertia tensor.
    No `param_gradient` propagation. The chain rule *could* be
    applied here in principle (the boundary integral has a
    well-defined θ-derivative via the divergence theorem on the
    smooth field), but it currently isn't.
  - This is the **fixable** break. Doable in a few hundred LOC,
    independent of the mesh-extraction question, would unlock
    analytic ∂(mass, COM, inertia)/∂θ. The Phase 5 spec already
    flagged it: `optim.rs:9-19` calls out "future hybrid
    approaches (analytic mass/inertia gradients + FD for the
    sim boundary)."
- **Third break** — the sim-core forward step is opaque to AD:
  - sim-core's `mj_step` is a hand-coded forward integrator with
    contact, constraints, and implicit damping. No autograd
    handshake. ml-bridge's autograd never touches `Model`/`Data`
    fields — it operates on f64 scalars in policy networks
    (`sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/autograd.rs`).
  - This is the same problem MuJoCo has been chasing for ~5
    years (MuJoCo MJX is the JAX port that solves it by
    rewriting the entire forward step in XLA). No shortcut.
- **The two AD systems are completely disconnected**:
  - `cf-design/Cargo.toml` does NOT depend on `sim-ml-bridge`.
  - `sim-ml-bridge/Cargo.toml` does NOT depend on `cf-design`.
  - Verified by direct read and by `grep`-ing for `cf_design`,
    `ParamStore`, `FieldNode` across `sim/L0/ml-bridge/src/` —
    zero matches.
  - cf-design's `param_gradient` is **forward-mode** analytic AD
    over a hand-rolled `FieldNode` enum (~273 LOC, scalar f64).
  - sim-ml-bridge's `autograd::Tape` is **reverse-mode** tape AD
    over scalar f64 ops (`add/sub/mul/neg/tanh/relu/square/ln/
    exp` + `affine/sum/mean`), explicitly RL-policy-oriented
    ("CPU f64 only," "no GPU tensors," "no batched tape").
  - There is no shared `Variable`/`Tensor` type, no shared scalar
    abstraction, and the two engines use opposite gradient
    styles. Fusing them is not a one-day port.
- **The shipping "differentiable design optimization"**:
  - `cf-design/src/optim.rs` is `minimize_fd` — centered finite-
    difference gradient descent over a user-provided objective
    closure. Lines 9-19 of the docstring are the smoking gun:
    > "For design-through-physics optimization, the end-to-end
    > gradient is `∂J/∂θ where θ → SDF(θ) → mesh → Model →
    > simulate → x_T → J(x_T)`. The middle of this chain
    > (`mesh → Model`) is not analytically differentiable, so
    > we use finite differences over the full pipeline.
    > Session 25's analytic `∂f/∂θ` enables future hybrid
    > approaches."
  - The Phase 5 integration test
    (`mechanism/integration.rs:328-457`,
    `phase5_parameterized_grasp_optimization`) drives a
    parameterized sphere onto a ground plane, measures contact
    force, and uses `minimize_fd` to find the radius that
    maximizes it. **Three** FD iterations, learning rate `1e-9`,
    `fd_eps=0.5`. End-to-end FD, full pipeline rebuild every
    eval (mechanism rebuild → MJCF emit → `sim_mjcf::load_model`
    → 500 sim steps → contact force sum → return scalar). No
    analytic gradients exercised anywhere in the test.
  - **There is no test, anywhere in the workspace, that
    exercises an end-to-end analytical θ-gradient from cf-design
    through sim-core**. `param_gradient` is exercised only
    against the field value itself, not against any downstream
    physics quantity.
- **The "Phase 5 = differentiable design optimization" framing
  is overstated**: Both the project-memory entry ("cf-design
  Phases 1–5 complete (including differentiable design
  optimization)") and §3 of this master plan ("cf-design
  (Phases 1–5 complete) with implicit surface composition,
  mechanism library, and **differentiable design optimization**")
  describe Phase 5 as if the gradient pipeline closes. It does
  not. The honest description is: **finite-difference design
  optimization through simulation, with analytic ∂f/∂θ at the
  SDF field level as a future hybrid lever.** This is a memory/
  doc nit, not a chassis nit; flagging here for future reference.
- **What this means for the build order** (the reason Q5 was
  escalated):
  - **Phases 1-4 are unaffected.** The Langevin thermostat
    chassis lives entirely on the sim-core side. None of the
    seven chassis decisions touches cf-design or its parameter
    pipeline. Phase 1 spec drafting can proceed unchanged.
  - **D3 (co-design) drops several rungs.** D3 was priority 3
    on the Research Directions ladder, ahead of D2 (stochastic
    resonance) and D4 (sim-to-real on a printed device). With
    the Q5 NO, D3 requires *either* a multi-month differentiable-
    forward-step research thread, *or* a surrogate-model
    workaround that crosses a fidelity boundary. Neither is
    sharpen-the-axe-cheap. **Recommend reshuffling**: D1 → D2
    → D4 → D3 → D5. D3 stays on the roadmap as the long-horizon
    "after we can differentiate through `mj_step`" item, not as
    the headline experiment.
  - **D1, D2, D4 are unblocked.** None of them require end-to-
    end gradients through cf-design. D1 (Brownian motor) and
    D2 (stochastic resonance) are pure sim experiments with
    fixed geometry, no design loop. D4 (sim-to-real on printed
    device) needs the design → print path, but the *training*
    happens via RL (sim-ml-bridge already shipped) on a fixed
    parameterization — no cf-design gradients required for the
    EBM training itself, only for *post-hoc* design refinement
    which is exactly what `minimize_fd` already does.
  - **The fixable second break (mass properties) is the cheapest
    capability gain.** Wiring `param_gradient` through
    `mass_properties` would give analytic ∂(mass, COM, inertia)/
    ∂θ for free, which is the part of the Model that benefits
    most from gradients (mass and inertia drive the dynamics
    linearly via `M` and `M⁻¹`). This is *not* on the thermo
    line's critical path, but it's worth flagging upstream to
    the cf-design team as a small, well-scoped follow-on.
- **Plausible reactions revisited** (from the Q5 entry in §5):
  1. **Build the differentiable layer earlier** — large surface
     area: differentiable mesh extraction (DiffMC or smooth
     surrogate) AND a differentiable forward step. Multi-month.
     Not recommended pre-Phase-1.
  2. **Re-prioritize D3 down the ladder** — RECOMMENDED. Cheap,
     consistent with sharpen-the-axe ("foundations over
     scaffolding"), preserves option to revisit later.
  3. **Surrogate model** — viable for D3 specifically, crosses a
     fidelity boundary. Defer the decision until D2/D4 results
     show whether D3's headline framing is still load-bearing.
  4. **Sibling crate wraps cf-design with custom autograd** —
     same surface area as option 1, just packaged differently.
     Not a free win.
- **Recon scope coverage** (from part 12 M3):
  - [x] cf-design autograd integration point — does not exist
    (no sim-ml-bridge dep); custom forward AD lives in
    `param_gradient.rs`.
  - [x] cf-design Phase 5 spec — `optim.rs` docstring is the
    authoritative description; no separate spec file
    (`docs/SDF_NATIVE_PHYSICS_SPEC.md` is the only doc and is
    about a different topic).
  - [x] SDF boolean differentiability — smooth booleans fully
    analytic; hard booleans subgradient-correct away from the
    seam.
  - [x] Mesh extraction — marching cubes + dual contouring,
    both topologically discrete, no smooth alternative.
  - [x] End-to-end gradient tests — none. `param_gradient` is
    tested against FD oracle on field values; the Phase 5
    integration test uses `minimize_fd` (full-pipeline FD)
    with no analytic gradient exercised.
- **Time spent**: ~30 minutes of focused reading. The answer
  was visible in the first file (`optim.rs:9-19`) but warranted
  the corroborating recon across `param_gradient.rs`,
  `mesher.rs`, `dual_contouring.rs`, `mass.rs`,
  `integration.rs`, both Cargo.toml files, and
  `ml-bridge/src/autograd.rs`. Asymmetric-risk argument from
  part 12 was correct: a half-day's recon would have been
  worth it even on a "yes," and the actual answer is "no" with
  build-order consequences.
- **What did NOT happen this session**: no code, no chassis
  edits, no Phase 1 spec drafting, no priority-ladder edit in
  §2.4 (the recommendation above is a recommendation, not a
  commit — pending user confirmation). The recon log entry is
  the only artifact.
- **Open follow-ons**:
  - Update §3 "Q5 status" line from "ESCALATED" to "RESOLVED
    (NO)" with a one-sentence summary pointer to part 13.
  - Update §5 Q5 entry to reflect resolution and link to this
    part.
  - Decide whether to reshuffle the §2.4 priority ladder
    (D1 → D2 → D4 → D3 → D5 recommended).
  - Decide whether to soften the "differentiable design
    optimization" phrasing in §3 and in the cf-design memory
    entry (`project_thermo_computing.md`, `MEMORY.md`) to
    "finite-difference design optimization with analytic
    ∂f/∂θ at the SDF level."
  - Optional cross-team flag: wiring `param_gradient` through
    `mass_properties` is a small, well-scoped cf-design follow-
    on that would unlock analytic mass/inertia gradients.
    Independent of the thermo line's critical path; surface to
    cf-design when convenient.
