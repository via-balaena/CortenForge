//! **Lattice-as-design-var co-design** — the *structural* axis of the optimizer.
//!
//! Where [`RouteTarget`](crate::RouteTarget) tunes the *shape* of a route and
//! [`SoftMaterialTarget`](crate::SoftMaterialTarget) tunes a *material*,
//! [`LatticeTarget`] tunes the **cross-section areas of the struts of a truss**:
//! given a fixed ground structure (nodes, connectivity, supports, load), the
//! per-strut areas `A₀ … A_{n−1}` are the design variables, optimized so the
//! structure is stiff (low compliance) without spending more material than it
//! must. This is mission connective-tissue #5 — the rung with *hundreds* of
//! design variables where "the strut is removed" (`Aₑ → 0`) is a legitimate,
//! common answer, so no per-strut outcome can be hand-checked.
//!
//! # The objective — mass-penalized compliance
//!
//! ```text
//! J(A) = C(A)  +  w · Σₑ Aₑ·Lₑ
//! ```
//!
//! `C(A) = fᵀu` is the truss compliance (the inverse-stiffness the load sees; small
//! `C` = stiff), and `Σ Aₑ·Lₑ` is the structural volume (a mass proxy at unit
//! density). The exchange rate `w` is a **calibrated knob**, not a free one: it is
//! the compliance you are willing to give up to save one unit of volume — raise it
//! and the optimizer trims more aggressively, driving marginal struts to zero;
//! lower it and it keeps material for stiffness. Both terms are non-negative, so the
//! two pull against each other and the minimum sits at the lightest structure that
//! still carries the load stiffly enough.
//!
//! Because the objective enters both a reward-free penalty *and* the compliance it
//! trades against, it is **bounded below by zero** (`C ≥ 0`, volume `≥ 0`, `w > 0`).
//! Unlike the signed-reward [`ConduitTarget`](crate::ConduitTarget) — which can run
//! `J → −∞` and so reports no bound — [`LatticeTarget`] declares
//! [`loss_lower_bound`](CoDesignProblem::loss_lower_bound) `= Some(0.0)`, a slack but
//! *sound* bound, so the loss-tolerance stop stays meaningful here.
//!
//! # Log-space areas and the analytic gradient
//!
//! Areas are positive, span orders of magnitude, and want *relative* optimizer
//! steps (a 10 % change means the same thing at a thick strut and a thin one), so
//! the parameter vector is `p = [ln A₀ … ln A_{n−1}]` — the internal
//! log-reparametrization of [`ConduitTarget`](crate::ConduitTarget) /
//! [`JointTarget`](crate::JointTarget),
//! which also keeps every `Aₑ = exp(pₑ) > 0` structurally.
//!
//! Unlike the geometry axis, the gradient here is **analytic**, not finite
//! differences: [`sim_truss`] returns the exact self-adjoint compliance sensitivity
//! `∂C/∂Aₑ` from the *same single solve* as `C` itself, so
//!
//! ```text
//! ∂J/∂pₑ = Aₑ · (∂C/∂Aₑ + w·Lₑ) .
//! ```
//!
//! One truss solve per evaluation yields the whole gradient vector — where central
//! FD would cost `n + 1` solves — which is why [`sim_truss`] ships sensitivities.
//!
//! # Collapse, and why the stop is not yet trustworthy at scale
//!
//! A strut carrying no load has optimal area zero, reached at `pₑ → −∞`; its
//! log-space gradient `∂J/∂pₑ = Aₑ·w·Lₑ` **vanishes as `Aₑ → 0`** even though the
//! physical gradient `w·Lₑ` is a nonzero constant. So a shrinking strut is
//! indistinguishable, by gradient norm, from a converged one —
//! [`ConduitTarget`](crate::ConduitTarget)'s
//! radius-collapse ambiguity, now replicated across *every* redundant strut at once
//! and impossible to hand-check. This target therefore leaves the metric-aware
//! stopping criterion to a later rung; the gates here *measure and pin* the
//! conditioning (see `tests/lattice_inverse_design.rs`) rather than trusting the
//! stop flag, exactly as the geometry gates assert physical outcomes.
//!
//! A design so under-strutted that its stiffness matrix is a **mechanism** is
//! reported as [`InfeasibleDesign`] (via [`try_evaluate`](CoDesignProblem::try_evaluate)),
//! the feasibility boundary the optimizer must respect — though the compliance term
//! (which blows up as a load-bearing strut thins) normally steers well clear of it.
