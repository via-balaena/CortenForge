# Changelog

All notable changes to mesh-printability will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- Inherited workspace lints (`[lints] workspace = true`); 6 per-statement
  `#[allow]`s preserve FP semantics on overhang-predicate sites where FMA
  (`mul_add`) and midpoint forms would shift FP bits at the threshold
  boundary. Bit-exactness deferral is tracked under
  [v0.9 candidates](#v09-candidates).

### Fixed

### v0.9 candidates

These deferrals are tracked here so per-site `#[allow]` justification
comments can reference a stable anchor that survives v0.8 spec deletion.

- **FP bit-exactness of overhang predicate (§5.1 deferral).** v0.8 keeps
  the non-FMA forms `(a * b) + c` and `(a + b) / 2.0` to preserve current
  overhang-detection FP bits across platforms. Re-open trigger: a
  cross-platform CI run on Gap H or Gap M fixtures shows divergence at
  the bit level (e.g., affected-face count differs by 1 between
  macOS/Linux/Windows on a fixture authored to land *exactly* on the
  threshold). Resolution path: either replace the per-site `#[allow]`s
  with `f64::mul_add` / `f64::midpoint` after a tolerance-based diff
  confirms semantic equivalence, or reframe the predicate to be
  FMA-stable across platforms.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-XX-XX

- Initial release with build-volume, overhang, and basic-manifold detectors.
